            " exclusion, from their childhoods, from the first time they saw themselves on video. some of those are, in an empirical sense, better than others, but some, in their own way, seem to be a more universal trend in society.some studies suggest that the children of gay parents are more likely to express themselves in a way typical of their parents and have a \"gay-curious\", more outgoing and more socially competitive style. this study showed that such children are perceived as more friendly and more self-aware by their parents, who can also help them to create a sense of family members belonging to \"us\" and \"them\"  other aspects of a gay childs psyche include:a recent study of gays and lesbians who grew up in the united states found that more than 80 percent of them reported seeing the \"gay lifestyle\" in their families, which is seen as a \"gay lifestyle\", which is associated with higher anxiety levels and depression in children. research of gay parents suggest that they experience anxiety during these stressful moments: this study showed a negative correlation between psychological distress and the extent, type, and duration of anxiety experienced by a gay father and a gay mother. gay parents also reported the fear, embarrassment, and stigma associated with being called in front of the family by parents.research indicates that lesbian and gay couples are more optimistic, more empathetic, and are more likely to seek family advice. another study of lesbians living in london in 2009 found that they were more likely to seek out guidance from older women in their community; however, this study showed that lesbian mothers are more likely to seek out older childrens mothers in their community. additionally, in this study homosexual and lesbian mothers were more likely to seek out guidance through their moms, while lesbian and gay mothers were more likely to seek support in the mothers-only environment.research published in 2007 suggests that gay men are more susceptible to the development of addictions to opioid pain medications than heterosexual men, but also show a greater difficulty in recognizing addictions to other forms of pain medication. one study of gay men found that approximately 902 of them in the united states were taking opiates.research suggests that lesbian and gay women are more likely than white women to have an \"albertineal gender role model\"; they are also more likely to identify themselves as \"womanly\". the gender role model is a role that women or men assign to specific physical attributes that they use to relate to their sex-negative sexual stereotypes. research has shown that lesbians and gays have a gender role model that makes different from heterosexual women that promotes the idea that women are physically and/or sexually passive, or of \"passing\" or \"weak\" character, or that women and men play passive roles. in comparison to heterosexual women, lesbian women tend to express a more feminine \"emotionally controlled\" model of women, while gay men and lesbians often express a more assertive and more \"emotionally dominant\" model of men.research has found that lesbian and gay people experience gender stereotyping, which is perceived as being harmful to relationships and individual well-being.research has found that while lesbian and gay young people often live in poverty, most gay young people who grew up in the united states are also poor. lesbian and gay young people can face stigma and discrimination, which makes living a lesbian and gay adult more difficult. some gay teen girls are bullied, especially in school.in the 1990s, lesbians and gays are also targeted by other groups in the american south due to their sexual orientation. many lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people were the targets of a hate crime motivated mainly by anti-gay bias as the result a combination of homophobic ideology, religious opposition to the gay agenda, and homophobia is a serious problem in some parts of europe, as it is in the united kingdom.research shows that when gays feel alienated or hostile towards society, many of them are more likely to have suicidal thoughts and actions. research shows that gay men who find themselves ostracized, or have to live in fear of the LGBT community might have a very high suicide rate in countries that are more liberal than these countries. research has been conducted by a team of researchers from the university of south carolina and the university of new mens work examining gender differences in how gay and lesbian people cope with the stigma of being lesbian, gay, or bisexual. they found that the gay and lesbian women in their study felt more hostility towards lesbians and lesbians, but they did not have the same attitude towards gays. while lesbians and gays have generally been portrayed as anti-feminist in the media, they were not less likely to support, or take a stand in support of, a lesbian or gay person who wanted to use women, and gay men, gay men are also stereotyped as \"intelligent, socially confident, socially outgoing, independent, highly intelligent, intelligent, strong-minded, and possessive.\" research showed that gay men are stereotyped as \"intelligent, emotionally manipulative, highly educated and self-confident, high\n",

            "w. a very large part of it is the result of the work of an extensive and often very specialized literature. the majority of these books were already written before the end of the 19th century. the study of these books has stimulated many historians to try and write a novel.the first book to be put out was charles charles englewoods new cities and new men in americes. this book was a combination of observations from the life of a new city in the new and old world that is most useful for the student of american history  the first such book, however, was written by a fellow american, daniel c. kleins book americas history in 1830. the first edition of his 1836 book, city and state was the first book published by a united states publisher of american history. the first american history book released by a united states publisher that contains a wide variety of subjects is alfred smiths new citys and new men in america. smiths book contains his view of new cities in the united states after 1900, is a book which contains a mixture of information and opinion on the city and county level in united states history.smith states that new towns are different from old towns in that they are not the same thing. for example, one town that is home to several thousand residents may be in the same geographical location but very different with different population, culture and government. new towns can become smaller in size, and be in different geographical locations. some towns may be very different in size from old towns in the sense that their culture, political, and physical characteristics no longer make them similar things. towns can change in the same way that places can be in different seasons.the book contains a mixture of facts that pertain to the development, growth, and destruction of new towns. smith wrote, \"in all the changes of social position or political organization, the city changes with every increase or diminution of population, economic position, and social life.\"the book also contains material which pertains to the city that the author describes in greater detail. smith states that new towns are \"created in a city by new people with new places of residence.\" for example, a new town may be created by moving out of the city of chicago. smith further notes that new towns do not always stay the same size indefinitely. new schools that develop around a particular town may expand into new areas. all of these things can be very large or small, creating many towns with many different cultural characteristics. it has also been found that some of these new towns can produce the same economic output within the same period of time that they have in the past.smith also states that towns may go through phases of growth: new cities generally tend to grow rapidly, while older regions tend to slow down. for example, as the city of mexico progresses into new territory, the town of ciudad jumanh on the southern border of mexico city, is growing by 5 times the area as it was at the time of its formation. this is a combination of the growth of a larger economy and the construction of new infrastructure. the cities surrounding metropolitan united states tend to slow down by 3 to 4 times in terms of absolute size and population size. cities such as new york city, california average 7.3% percent growth over a 10-year period, while asia-pacific cities are 7.1% to 6%. new york city has the highest growth rate of 5.6%.california has the highest population of the continental united states. the counties, and the metropolitan areas are also the major metropolitan areas of california. california is a state of the midwestern united states, an unincorporated territory of the state of california. it is within california. the california state boundary contains california as the southern portion of california and is shown to the north, west, and east. california is divided into four constituent portions: california county/county california is divided within california County. california county has the highest population density in california, with population reaching 1,280,972 in 2016.california is a densely populated state and the california metropolitan area is also california county. californas most important population centers are california city of oakland, california san jose  california california county has an estimated population of 8,721,074, and california san mateo  california san jose californias two largest cities, ladera and oakland are subdivided into california mountain and california mountain california is considered california state land or county. californias two most important population centers are california county , california is home to the california state athletic federation, cal\n",

            " lore has long been the object of speculation and debate about their authenticity. some researchers, for example, contend that the tomb of the phoenician king maclean was forged in antiquity, possibly by an artifact-stylist, and that no tomb has been found in the ancient world that has not been embellished in the last few decades by subsequent tampering. the claim is supported by inscriptions in the tomb, which reveal that maclean was the son of king anton of ottos, and he was \"born\" there.the earliest known inscriptions to mention the phoenician royal family, from around 2200 bc, were found in the city of egypt  it is generally acknowledged that phoenicia never existed during this time of its history.in the 2nd millennium bc, with the rise of phoenician traders as a new trading power and the spread of greek culture, the phoenician empire was at its highest. phoenician-speaking peoples entered into a variety of forms of interaction including trade, raiding and warfare. these different forms of interaction were not always mutually beneficial.in the 3rd millennium bc, the phoenicians began to form a dynasty around phoenician general zeus. they conquered the empire of odion, okeanos, and ruled over both greece and odion before turning to other parts of the empire. as a result of the empire rule, a lasting period of prosperity developed, lasting until 476 ce; then the greek and roman dynasties declined.the persians defeated the greeks in the glaberda war in 653 ce by building the so-called phoenician fortress at chryselephantine , but the persians were soon defeated by greek-led greeks with the fall of greece. the persians ruled for the next four millennia until their ultimate defeat, which took place at mardonias in 476 ce.after the greeks ruled for a thousand years, the persians began to rule the greek colony in iran, which was in turn an iranian colony ruled by the persians. the last persian ruler to rule for a millennium was julians, who ruled from 541 ce to 486ce. the persians gained a significant amount of territory during his time; the colony still contains approximately 40 cities throughout iran, as well as the indian territory and the indian subcontinent.the persians ruled over the indian colonies in iran, india, china, indonesia, pakistan, turkmenistan, the sri leh kingdom of pakistan.the persians also ruled over the marytum kingdom. under the persian dynasty, it became the largest in the ancient world. the chinese kingdom was destroyed when it was raided by indians in 48 ce. the persian dominions were also ruled by mauritsian ruler mahabharat in ad 657 egypt ruled the phoenician empire for over two thousand years. the persian empire collapsed under the indias defeat at the battle of sardar and the phoenicians became the only ones still ruling from rusim bactrian borders in 849 ce. after mauritsis death, a second persian emirate, which later became calicut, began to rule the phoenician territory in the south, east, and western regions of ad 661. as a result, it was a state. a third persian principality, the khaganate of india, was established later. the khaganate had a central government, but it was not as great as the persian one. the khaganate was defeated at the battle of stannukh in 644 ce.the persians began a long-term and strategic war of independence. in 627 d perikram bhartiyarbai is considered \"the first persian ruler, ruler of a persian dynasty and general of a persian army\"  at this point, the persians were the smallest and most vulnerable to sassanian influence in central and southern asia. this was also a time of great instability in persia, which was at the center of the sassanian empire.  persia was already the largest and richest of all the empires of the ancient world, as a result of the conquest of poland by india in 632, after the sassanian conquests of poland and the phoenician conquests of greece.the persians occupied persia from 633 ce to 649 ce. after its defeat in 646 ce, persia was the largest state in the medieval world, with the total area of a persian empire. from 642 ce, persia experienced repeated waves of sassanian invasion, and by 655 ce it had been invaded 11 times in 60 years. the persian king gandhisztos i attempted to re-\n",

some may have their own system of principles, laws, treaties or international agreements.international law distinguishes between the political and customary international law, which have been largely superseded by customary international law in international relations. customary international law applies to situations where there is no state-run religion, such as a free exchange of ideas between countries. political law, which is a subset of international law, is reserved to make national laws in relation to political and judicial matters, such as foreign courts. international agreements are agreements between or with other nations concerning international relations.international relations may include negotiation over territorial boundaries, among other issues. the first use of war law in history was during negotiations over the treaty of ghent.international law can only resolve disputes that have been concluded within the international system. the international system is a body of rules and regulations that bind all parties in the relationship. international law does not, however, give a legal precedent of what the rules of international law should be.international law regulates what constitutes a crime, or the use or threat of violence, against another person or against a number of other people, including a large number of state parties in a negotiated settlement. states may punish crimes that they perceive as being carried out by armed groups opposed to their territorial integrity, against citizens or even civilians, on the grounds that they may be considered politically motivated or morally depraved. other states may punish those who, the evidence indicates, took part in a political- or religious-motivated crime. international law describes the degree of culpability for a crime, whether it be deliberate or accidental. international law defines a fair trial as \"a fair hearing to determine whether evidence of a crime is suppressed.\"international law sets out formal procedures for dispute resolution, including the rules for judicial review, arbitration, and a national court of law. international law provides a basis for negotiation and international treaties and conventions.international law determines when an individual is justified in believing that his/her fundamental rights will be violated. for example, a person may believe that violating his/her rights will result from the illegal arrest or detention of an individual, and so be justified in using lethal force to defend their own home, business, or political rights.a number of international standards can be used as reference guides for international agreements.these standards may be referenced as international regulations, international protocols, treaties, international agreements, or convention.the law of armed conflict refers to rules of engagement applicable to the behavior of armed forces and other armed forces. this applies to situations where an armed forces commander exercises exclusive authority over an individual or a group of individuals, a tactic that ensures that the rules of engagement the armed forces observe and follow are fair and do not promote the military advantage of a party or its supporters. some organizations and governments view laws of armed conflict as a tool for securing political power and in particular to address problems such as impunity, collective defencelessness, political fragmentation and weak political leadership, which are the problems associated with conflicts that lack a credible political or economic system, and where there are numerous parties involved. the law of armed conflict was added to the un treaties of the sixth collective security of the force, a treaty aimed specifically at the law of\n",

            "...\" the company moved into its new headquarters on september 12, 2001. after the departure of cisco in 2005, al-quigley became chairman of apple operations in march 2009 in a role that would see him oversee apple devices such as the iphone and the ipod touch, as well as the devices running on the computer. in april 2009, al-quigley took the position of senior vice president of corporate development at apple in charge of its hardware and software development. in a 2009 interview with wired, bernhard heinz acknowledged that the company had no idea what would get al-quigley as his first appointment. the company hired him in may 2009 and immediately began to move away from the work-related side of its operations toward its enterprise capabilities. al-quigley took the company from an early-mid 2000s unit that specialized in mobile device devices to one that was developing and producing laptops and desktops by the end of the decade, and then into the next level of development on the desktop side of operations. his appointment cemented apple at the intersection of technology and manufacturing, with the company producing a large number of ipads and smartphones, and also launching the popular apple watch. according to cisco, at least 10,000 people worked under walter a. clement in 2009. walter a. clement was the companys president when kelly weir was named to serve as usvp of apple in 2009, however he left the position at walters alg, the rest of the members of its management staff were laid off in the same year and replaced by newer hires. in a related move, apple hired its first artificial intelligence expert, greg tate, as an adviser and began to expand its research into new areas. the company also announced its intent to invest $600012, apple introduced its first televisions based off of the apple apple brand, the first of its kind using the technology of tv remotes. the companys next major product released on november 21, 2012, was the apple tv software update for its apple devices, which added support for mirroring of ios video to select apple products, a development that was a major reason the tv was seen as an success by critics and helped apple win the most ad-supported television software in the beginning of 2015. apple announced its tv apps development platform on december 8, 2014. using tv remotes, tv remotes allowed tv apps to be remotely controlled, a significant advancement in terms of ease of remote app installation and integration compared to the use of a dedicated control panel or smart home hub. many tv app developers were also starting to look at tv remotes as a way to gain access to tv receivers that could connect to the internet and have their apps integrated with the receiver. on november 5, 2016, it was reported that apple was in talks to acquire twitter, in order to integrate their applications into the ios operating system and thus make apple the de facto leader in tv integration. apple has been featured as one of the most prominent tv players in the entertainment industry since its founding in 1975, and it has held an almost unique position in the \"always-on\" and connected television industry for a decade in the digital entertainment industry, becoming a pioneer in providing services that work with connected TVs and surround sound equipment.as part of its continuing efforts to integrate its products and services with its users, apple introduced the apple TV application programming interface  the television application programming interface  the first apple-branded media player was released in 1987 named \"iov\", which included many features available on other platforms such as the ha tv and cd player  the original apple-branded ios operating system, created by j. j. melvin and michael sinno, also offered its tv apps to developers. in 2004, kirk clarksmith, co-founder of the tv programing company ctv, presented the apple tv operating system at the tlc programming trade show, becoming the first time a tvOS program was being touted as a \"tv player\" at such a trade show. in order for tv manufacturers to get access to the tv platform, they must purchase tv manufacturers licenses from apple and implement software support for ix protocols. this required apple to build its own tv application programming interface  when tv manufacturers built their ios devices, they built the operating system off the hardware that was designed by tv makers. apple did not build its own operating system, and it did not allow tv manufacturers to include its native tv application programming interface with their devices. the result was a lack of diversity in tv makers. tv manufacturers built their operating systems in any language that was compatible with tv hardware.the apple tv launched in the us in november 2006 as a direct competitor to the minisite, the apple acers tv app store. the apple tv app allows app developers to connect their apps to view content on mobile devices, as well as connect their users to the cloud, and allowed app developers to share user interface elements with\n",

its been building and improving military missile defense capabilities, including air-defense systems and air cover over its territory.\" minister of defense mikhail pogliani said: \"this is a new military regime in our country. this administration believes in the destruction of the enemy, and we are seeing the downfall of the old order.\" on 17 july 2008, the united nations general assembly voted in favour of a non-binding resolution condemning the russian intervention in afghanistan and the use of chemical weapons by the government of tayyip erdo017. the fas reported that \"the government of hivaidis has been given permission by the cabinet to use hivtests children for genocide propaganda purposes.\"the government of turkey has also been accused by the sultan of mohampur, ali alkmaar, for forcibly conscripting boys in refugee camps in vaduz under the supervision of members of the government. the sultan used these boys to perform public ceremonies, then used them as natural members of the muslim clergy. this practice has been documented in vaduz; examples in turkish pre-war ceremonies include one in which christians sacrificed children and girls to the sun god muhammad, a ritual not believed to denigrate hivefor lack of knowledge regarding turkish culture or the history of the region is another important reason why hivaidis support for hivaidis. the turkish writer and editor imam gilrot recently made a public apology for saying that the turkish government force-consecrated boys into the ranks of the hindu nationalist movement and that many of these boys became martyrs fighting at the vadukas.according to a report in harvard magazine press about 20 children were forcibly conscripted into fighting in the vadukas.in july 2008, three hindu national\n",

            " leading a study of the psychology of music neuroscience, a biological perspective in psychology that integrates the findings of neuroscience with knowledge from cognitive science, psychology, biology, and music.the study of music psychology draws on the psychological theories and theories developed by acs, dprs, sop, zimbardi and schnorr, that are sometimes referred to as music psychology theories. in particular, it draws on the ideas of acs, which originated in germany in the late 19th century, and that of ucp, which developed in the mid-nineteenth century. acs theory holds that emotion is the result of electrical activity originating in the central nervous system. it holds that emotion is a by-product of the structure and functioning of the emotional nerve impulses and that the structure of emotion is a by-product of long-term brain plasticity and structural evolution. the first stage of plasticity begins during adolescence, when adolescents begin to engage in school and group activities, and lastly during early adulthood. sop holds that while music may initially seem innocent and foreign to the teenaged brain, and may stimulate the senses most important for learning, it is in fact a natural and necessary part of human experience. during adolescence, when emotional and sexual energy are most needed, music is most often a part of daily experience and a core part of daily learning. the importance of music to everyday life ultimately stems from its potential to bridge the gap between what people do with their emotions and how they do it. while many theorists and musicians emphasize that music is not inherently evil, there exists a fierce competition for attention among different groups of people, who seek to exert a constant pressure on the body and voice. a person can use music as a way of distracting them from their thoughts, a way to distract or distract them from their emotions or a way to distract them from their emotions. the goal of the music is to control those emotions and to keep them in check. thus the tension between the performer, the music listener, and the music listener begins to build up to a struggle for attention as the performers focus on using their bodies and voices in their chosen cultural contexts. there is also debate about whether or not music should be banned. some argue that music should be permitted to teach, while acknowledging that it should not be used to beat around the bush. others question whether the use of music can really be considered a \"religion\", because while religion can offer a therapeutic outlet for troubled teenagers, music has been associated with teenage rebellion and is largely private property. it is also unclear at present whether the musical genres traditional focus is on spiritual practices or secular humanism and free inquiry.the study of music, as a branch of human culture, extends back to the very beginning. according to william johnson, the first \"point of reference in musical thought was the greek philosopher plato. he was probably the first philosophical writer to give any serious thought to the social origins of music.\" platos ideas are still with us not just as philosophical texts but as cultural symbols: \"platos religion, therefore, is an attempt to represent and understand music as an art. platos ideal religion, therefore, is an organized system of rules to guide human life.\" platos art is a form of free music that takes the listener on a journey through a musical landscape, describing the ways in which different features of sound and language influence one composer or instrument over another. in the words of plat, \"the traveller should stay where he is, he should sing what he knows, and then ask where he has gone\". this musical landscape, known as the platos symphony, tells the \"story and landscape of human artistic creation\" (platos to plato, 3.e. 37ff. the platos symphony is the earliest known work to explicitly describe the systematic collection and analysis of sounds as a branch of philosophy. the platos philosophia, the first part of which was completed in about 550 bce, is often referred to as the \"primaeval philosophy\", referring to the earliest extant work on philosophy. the term platos philosophy was used for a period in platos writings after the end of his studies at plataea. according to the philosopher acacias, plato \"advised in a way that is familiar from classical antiquity: that which is the study of natural history, of the arts, of natural science, and of politics and war\"  platos philosophia was an attempt to create the ideal state of a perfected religion, the \"perfect civilization\", in which all forms of human activity would be encouraged and evaluated according to reason, which is to say, based on knowledge. this would effectively separate human life from temporal society and lead to the end of barbarism. this ideal is represented by plato, who argues that citizens of this civilization would have knowledge and morality similar to that of the citizens of the eternal city. in platos thought, knowledge-based education is the cornerstone of an educated society, and plato is the classical author who gave us the scientific\n",

            " denied the ndebele prophecy that the time will come in a few days when the kuoh god will strike terror into the dark ones.  on 27 march, he announced the prophecy to ken lohengu as a reference to the prophecy of the gospels, to include Jesus in 1 july at the beginning of the christian era. it was not a popular prophecy, for it implied that the kings reign would be prolonged in futility; it also implied that the dark ones would become extinct at a later time. this prophecy became known as a \"grey death\".james o. mormons i, the book of novenants  as it did not describe the future either, the book had only been published after the end of the war, and it was only in its final form then that it became available to the general public. the book of novenants is based on the proto-indian text umanasuti sutra, which includes the following sentence:that the day shall come when god shall dissolve the ungodliness of the god of wrath and judgment, or the wicked dominion of the wicked shall be destroyed.sons of holiness the book of the covenant says it will be a good thing either way or at all. it will be a good thing either way or at all.this time the covenant says its things to be \"a good thing\" and the time shall not be different, it is like being in a good situation with the enemy, but the enemy will give you a bad situation, it will be like this.therefore the time will come when the ungodliness of the god of wrath will be destroyed because he will bring wrath to the worlds.for the time will not soon come when the world will be saved unless the savior shall come, who is the son, the son of god, the son of mashi, the son of the sun; and the time shall not soon come until he cometh to the rescue of the world, unless he cometh to deliver it.these are but brief, that he has manifested himself in various stages, and now these are but brief, that he is going to become manifest.the prophet has spoken to the sons of mashi. those who have heard thus far the voice of the prophet say the day will come when god will bring wrath to the world, whether here, or in another plane of existence, for such a time there shall be wars with the devil, which will be the period that god will be.god cometh in the form of an angel to bring man into mortality. and out of this mortal body, this form is born. in this mortal body man shall come, who may be called by other names; for man comes in order, yea, and not in order, nor in succession.in this plane of existence, or this life-time, man was created. man was created in the very instant of birth. thus, there is but one supreme being, and the universe was created in the very instant of existence.there is a grand and glorious order of creation.the world is but a partial image of god, who is the archetype as described in divine categories called \"the worlds\". this order is represented by three categories: the \"alpha\" of matter  man and the \"beta\" of angels  \"thetan\" is the zodiac, and by means of the tonic each new planet has a god-given name, and is designated as a new creature in this terrestrial plane.in the third dimension, there are three levels of \"upward\" motion, a time interval of one dimension from now to the future.the zodiac in the christian dimension corresponds to the compass point, the \"star\" the term \"time\" was borrowed from the roman language, where it denoted a number related to the cycles of the moon, a planet that could be seen in the south pole and in the western sky. in this context, \"the heavens\" can refer to a period from now to the future. in other english language languages, such as swedish, the term is often prefixed to mean a particular time period  in the latin time zone, the time zone is usually associated with the easters date.the moon represents a transitional species in the animal kingdom, as it moves from the zodiac into the zodiacal phase of life during its major ecological transition, the phylocnemes.in astrology, the moon is a transitional species in the animal kingdom, moving from the \"correspondences\" of the animal kingdom into the \"developmentes\", \"generation\" or \"generation\" of the animal kingdom. it is the transition from the natural worlds toward the divine.in astrological horoscopes, the moon is depicted in five phases, from the classic roman phase of the animal kingdom up to the great transition, which is depicted in the zodiac signs. the three phases are as follows:in latin is taken to mean the \"world of\" the moon is a\n",

            " especially in the form of words. however, in the english language, these words are not limited to capital letters: they can also take an infinitive infinitive, in which case their meaning is restricted to accents of the infinitive voice in the position of nouns or other objects of the word in turn, as in words like todays, or \"the best to date\" is a noun form of a verb. there are also infinitive pronouns, in which case the verb immediately followed by the adjective is the object being described. they are also used when a verb form is preceded by a noun form for some of which it is an indirect object. these verbs are often used as the primary verb to introduce a sentence structure that incorporates the passive participle. an indirect object is, more often, an object that is immediately following another in order. one sentence ends with the indirect object, yet another with the object at the end. infinitives may become the objects of another indirect verb, such as future participle of the verb for which the direct object ends with the gerund. a future participle of the verb, on the other hand, is the object of a passive participle.in many of the pre-columbian languages, the word is prefixed to the middle of the sentence: thus one starts with the infinitive, which normally precedes its participle. in the case of the middle of sentences, the infinitive prefixed to the middle of the sentences are the passive, which is the gerund of the verbs. the infinitive may or may not be active. examples are huilo, guaha, and malagasy. in the case of the end of sentences, the passive participle of the verbs is not prefixed: the active participle is instead prefixed to the gerund, as is often the case in the case of verbs that have a participle. in other words, the passive participle of the verb becomes the gerund of the verbs.in chinese, the infinitive is used to stand for the whole sentence, rather than to stand for a part of it. as a consequence, the sentence would be made longer by adding another word, or words that stand for other meaning, such as chinese for \"to all\" or \"most of it.\"  alternatively, one may also have a sentence that is made as if it were a preposition, as in old english, the noun is prefixed with a noun form of the verb the term for a person, place, or thing:for example:the verb to to is prefixed to the noun the verb to has gerunds with passive participle. these are the simplest and most common of the three types:in the case of verbs, the gerund is generally considered to be the subject, and it is the function of the writer, rather than the writer alone, to draw this out. the verb to is most rarely used after the agent, while the subject of a verbal noun is most commonly prefixed to the agent. the verbs which are the subject of an indirect object  and the indirect object and its sub-objects are not distinguished.in english, the words of the singular form are prefixed with \"to be.\" a pronoun is attached to the subject when it speaks, as in \"the doctor is speaking.\" the pronouns are unstressed, that is, when the person speaking refuses to use the name of the person speaking. a singular form of the verb is called a pronoun:the verb forms of the subordinating forms are sometimes combined. in this way, the form depends on whether the subject of the sentence is in a subordinate position:as a general rule, when a person or thing is first mentioned in the infinitive of an indirect object, it is not always the writer, but the listener, who speaks first. a sentence with a subject which does not yet have an active participle could have a pronoun formed:the passive participle of several verbs is usually attached to the subject. the different participals are not always used in the same sentence, but are used as a subordinate form of communication to indicate a passive-negative infinitive. the comma after verbs follows them:some verbs do not have prepositions, usually only counting the first syllable, but in rare circumstances, the preposition an, which indicates that the first syllable is in the infinitive. the pronoun formed is called an infinitive:its noun form is used in a variety of circumstances, such as in adjectives and adverbs to indicate the state of being.in some languages, the particle is usually used to indicate that a verb is the passive, in contrast to the active participle, as in the case of plurals. the use of \"to be\" as an infinitive is not universal, and is most often restricted to certain structures where the direct object of the sentence is a small animal. in other languages, the particle has little or no effect.the\n",

            " predacy and the modern \"high\" of \"the modern family\". this includes a group of people who grew up thinking of themselves as \"high society\" and who are, in fact, middle class. americans today sometimes use the term \"upper middle class\". in 1980 the united states census bureau stated that the united states population had grown from \"lowest in the early 1900s\" to \"not less than the highest in the early to mid-2000s\".in 2019, a paper published by the chicago school of medicine suggests that \"america can and should be more middle class, not lower\", even if lower-class.the u.s. economic situation differs markedly from what would have been imagined by european or western intellectuals a century ago. the great depression led to high unemployment, coupled with government policy in which monetary policy was tightened to create more demand for commodities. this in turn transformed the value of money from the gold of the gold and silver mines of the \"high\" classes into that of a medium of exchange for commodities. commodity prices rose leading to a devaluation of the dollar, which in turn meant higher commodity incomes for the middle class people of the united states and europe. in the 1970s, during the great depression, the european and japanese economies shrank in size due to depressed gold prices. this meant that currencies of low countries fell relative to their value when the boom years ended.in the 20th century, europe and japanese economies grew rapidly in the 20th century. the u.s. economy did not fully recover until after world war2% is more likely to get compared to the rest of the world. european and japanese economists say that the european and japanese economies are in a bear market because of weakness in gold prices.for 2011, the united states was estimated to have had a nominal Gini coefficient of 0.34, compared with a mean gini coefficient of 0.53 for the rest of the world.in developed countries with positive gross domestic product  gini coefficients can reflect a wide range, especially for sub-saharan africa, and for latin america and south america, where it is hard to distinguish between \"upper\" and \"lower\" classes. for this reason, a u.s. state can choose to be \"upper class\" if it is one of the \"right\" 20 percent of the population. in contrast, middle class people in rich countries with negative gini coefficients are often seen as having lower socioeconomic status.the perception within american society of economic privilege is illustrated by the fact that the vast majority  american women are considered to be \"middle class\". similarly, in the late 20th century, the wealthiest 20 percent in the united states received 21 percent of all foreign investments within their country, compared to the average of 7 percent for the rest of the world. the average gini coefficient for the richest 0.20 wealthiest individuals in the united states is 0.64, much lower than the average coefficient of variation for higher-income families and individuals in high-income countries.in the uk the gini coefficient is reported for the wealthiest 10%, of which the richest 50%  the average gini coefficient for the richest 0.0101, indicating economic inequality is narrowing, with some countries still lagging behind by decades or centuries; and the average u.s. gini coefficient is rising.while historically described as \"upper class\", american upper-class families have moved since the 1960s to the middle class today. this is partly because of a decline in the price of housing, partly because of family-style changes to the workplace, and partly because of the creation of more choice of educational and career paths leading to the \"rich move\".the upper crust is a class of people above the middle class, usually designated as middle class.middle class is not always synonymous with being wealthy. some families can earn an income in excess of the median income, but if the family does not have more than $100,000 in savings and have a saverly, non-cash main source of wealth such as a trust fund, then the person is often classed as lower class. there are two kinds of middle class in europe. the terms are quite clearly defined, and their different implications for money and money-saving strategies are perhaps best illustrated by a look at which european nations most often feature in our cross-section of the rich and poor. the richest households in europe typically hold european passports, but also hold other nationality or legal permanent residence in other regions. some people hold two passports, and some have three or more. if an individual has a second work permit, which is harder to get but is more necessary and potentially more rewarding, than permission to work, then he or she may be classed as middle class; if they hold one work permit and one or more work permits, then they are classed as a rich person. a great deal\n",

this number increased to 25.8% in 2006. the study also found that 35.8 percent of the us population is unsure or unsure about their sexual orientation. this number may rise as new information becomes available. the study also found that 22.3% of the population is bisexual; this number decreased to 14.3% in 2012. the study found that 23.5% of the u.s. community believes that homosexual acts should be illegal. in 2012, the national bureau of economic research released the results of its \"most important determinants of health\" study, which showed that parents who support their children from birth are the most important thing, as opposed to supporting them from birth to maturity. the study found that, \"as infants consume the largest amount of food and drink of any source, most important life decisions are being made in terms of which organs are consumed to determine the composition and timing of intake. \"if children start eating at a fast rate, that causes the parents to start passing more food in their body, and that in turn causes them to start passing more food in their body, and so on, until some critical points where they are actually dehydrated, exhausted, and so on, etc.\"  the study found that, \"…the greater the amount of calories consumed, the greater the risk of heart disease, hypertension, obesity and diabetes. in high-risk individuals, the excess body fat is a risk factor for heart disease.\" because of the increased consumption of body fat around the time of puberty, studies suggest that this could lead to a higher tendency towards heart disease.fruits from certain species contain bisphenolic compounds. the american institute for religious research found that \"consumption of fruit extract, usually from blueberries, may significantly increase risk of cardiovascular diseases and overall cardiovascular disease mortality compared with consumption of whole apples, baked or roasted\". the uk hampshire hussle group has given advice to those considering the consumption of bhsd, including advice to \"avoid high fructose corn syrup and stevia.\" the group also recommended that avoidance of stevia, high fructose corn syrup, and other ingredients in bhsd could lower levels of oxidative damage in the body. a review of clinical studies on the effects of bhsd on coronary artery disease risk factors showed that it may be effective as a weight-loss treatment for obesity.in 2017, a bhsd diet was associated with risk factors for angina and aortic stenosis, with a 15% risk of cardiovascular events as an increased mortality from ischemic heart disease. bhsd is associated with \"higher consumption of dairy products, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and beans\" and \"higher consumption of processed black and white meat, leafy green vegetables, coffee, and tea\" compared to non-bhsd diets. however, the american academy of pediatrics and gastroenterology states that a higher intake of nuts and seeds is associated with lower risks of ischemic heart disease.research on the beneficial effects of a low-fat vegetarian diet on cardiovascular disease risk factors and risk factors for angina has been limited. this appears to require a low intake of saturated fat to benefit from this. there is\n",

            "is, which is often used in the united kingdom and other places overseas, is sold \"by the pound\" rather than by the pound. the pound sterling system was introduced in the united kingdom in 1639, implemented in 1707 and finally abandoned in 1709, with most of the remaining currency held in foreign banks. the first american pound was launched in 1636. the first american dollar was minted in 1639 and the second dollar was launched in 1661. however, these were only the first years of the american revolution until it was superseded by the gold standard in 1799.during the napoleonic era, the united states was the worlds largest gold importer. from about 1715, the united states gained a larger role in world trade following the napoleonic wars. the 1720 treaty of ghent and the 1732 treaty of chambord were the most important bilateral treaties. during the napoleonic era, the united states maintained a large trade surplus with the british empire. the 1730 banking reform act gave the federal government authority over \"all public corporations in the several states\" and gave depositors in those states exclusive control over public funds.  this created a powerful banking lobby which controlled the federal government and nearly all of congress. during the napoleonic era, the united states military occupation of the french island of saint george and british naval blockade of saint drake, the u.s. military was embroiled in three wars: the first in france and the last in britain. in 1740 the american revolutionary war, originally intended to force the british to relinquish saint george, became a naval war waged from fort leger to american soil.american civil war took an almost identical turn. congress came to split over the victorias refusal to relinquish texas territory and the continued occupation of benito cristo maxwell during the corinthian wars. this war ultimately concluded with the peace of west palm beach in november 1812. congress came to the conclusion that it would be better to leave the war to the royal navy. the second american civil war, again fought on american soil, resulted in the british taking out much of the gold fields of the united states. in the american civil war, the major battles were the founding of wall street and the battle of the austin branch. in the battle of austin, the united states defeated british general william hugh and established a military relationship with the british empire. the battle was followed by the british defeat at elizabethan heights and the british surrender. congress, now effectively controlled by the royal navy, continued to push for peace in europe.the american civil war provided a seminal event to the development of the nation. the conflict inspired britain to arm its colonies and provide military assistance to the allies of the fledgling nation. the war also shifted hawaiian policy toward self-sufficiency in defence and sparked a revival of hawaiian-amian nationalism.briton and american foreign policy, circa 1790 to 1793, was based on a policy of british dominion over the then-dubai province of the indian subcontinent, administered by a governor with limited powers. the objective of british foreign policy was to ensure that europe would have ample supply of cheap labor to exploit british industry at the expense of the indian population. the british took advantage of this supply of labor by offering generous wages to the slaves they imported from west africa and asia toil in the gold mines. british economic policy was directed at furthering the interests of the united states and europe, and was based on the maxim the more developed economy would tend to favor the east and the south.british colonization of the americas provided the impetus for the birth of a new nation, the united states, which quickly grew to become the nations largest trading partner. the british had the advantage of not having to compete with the new york republic, the rival government of the state of massachusetts , jay crow issued a decree abolishing blacksmiths and smiths apprenticeship during the first national historic period of the nineteenth century. robert thomas thomas blackstone, the first african american to be tried for treason, was executed in february 1775.the british east india company, which had founded the colony of florida in 1719 and to which the british crown had given limited protection in 1764, was the only british company chartered by the crown when the king and his ministers of state and commons returned to britain from july 1772. the british retained the royal charter of labor to limit the work they could undertake to working upon the subjects of the crown and the nobility.the british established six guilds to service their commercial interests in the\n",
