0," the german army defeated the austro-hungarian army on december 17, 1871. the german invasion of austria began on february 13, 1872. the austro-hungarian army under general karl von langobardt launched the first major offensive of the war in may, capturing austrian cities such as bergamo and orsvany.the german invasion of poland started on july 13, 1872, when the german army landed in lynd, a town in the lothar region of poland. a small army under major general von lunge followed shortly, and hit ludendorffsburg on july 19, forcing the surrender of poland   the allied soldiers of the empire supported the polands annexation to the empire.the defeat of the austro-hungarian army at the battle of bethoven hastened by the war. germany was left with a large territory in central europe at the end of the war, which it used to start its war against the austro-hungarian army of the east. the bethoven offensive was the most successful of the three major wars. it started the first german offensive in the west, which ended with the bethovenus defeat, on march 13, 1873.the austro-hungarian offensive in the eastern front continued for some time, and the german army of the east continually advanced in the west. at the battle of bethoven, the austro-hungarian army under von lunge defeated the austro-hungarian army under general wilson, who had been encircling grain warehouses in the west. the austro-hungarian victory in this battle was the first time the austro-hungarian army had truly crossed the frontier into europe.the austro-hungarian army of the east left the west and headed towards south africa, while the german army of the south headed towards central europe. both armies engaged in a protracted battle for territory and supplies, with the german army taking significant losses. the battle of bethoven was the first major austro-hungarian offensive in the war. it started the second german offensive in the west, which ended with the battle of elkhorn on june 7, 1872. the battle was the first major austro-hungarian offensive in the war after the battle of kur panenka in october, which also saw the german army of the east cross-over the line and head towards the lothar frontier. in the battle of bethoven, the german army broke the austro-hungarian army in their main supply route, defeated the austro-hungarian army at the battle of bethoven, and then crossed the elkhorn river into south africa.soviet forces under stalin launched an offensive that began in the spring of the following year, roughly synchronising with the german advance through the west. this was followed up by the battle of kursk, which saw the german army of the soviet east respond by encircling the soviet army of the north at kursk, thus completing the territorial gain made by the soviet armies at kursk.the war led to a large scale devastation in the soviet empire. on the eastern front, the german army of the soviet east overwhelming retained their territory in central europe, while the soviet armies of the soviets far comprised only a small proportion of german territory. in the caucasus war the soviet armies were in a superior position, having a strong foothold in the areas that germany had occupied previously. the caucasus campaign was the first major soviet military campaign in the war since world war ii.the war began as a series of raids into the caucasus region by germany, which began in the 17th century and ended in the war of the caucasus. it started with the german invasions of the soviet union in the 17th century and the caucasus campaign in the 18th century. the core issues were the frontier and the role of the soviet union as a protector of the frontier. the war of the caucasus was fought over the territory of caucasus, between the soviet union and the united states of america. the caucasus war became a major german conflict when the soviet union declared war on the united states of america on august 1, 1918, and the allied powers, working with the united states, began airdrop and drop attacks on the soviet union as well as coalition forces in the caucasus. the allied power dropped its bombing of caucasus during the caucasus campaign and stopped attacking caucasus itself in the last two years of the war. the allied powers also stopped the caucasus war in 1918 by",0,1
1," of the species, the ancestors have been found to live in the tropical and subtropical regions of asia and eurasia, from the caribbean coast of south america to the pacific ocean, and from north america to india. the diet of most species consists of insects and worms, with the latter resembling the diet of the austronesian and pangolins. in western parts of asia, the staple food is the pangolin, while in china, the staple food is the python.the distribution of terrestrial vertebrates, including birds and mammals, in asia and africa is not uniform. many asian islands have largely marine habitats, while marshes are sparsely populated and the land mass is dominated by seabirds and mammals. fish are rare in south america, while the lionfth century, the number of species on earth was estimated at around 1.5 billion, with the remaining ones being ground-dwelling animals. about 700 million people live in areas which lie close to the arctic circle, and only about 60 million people live in the northern hemisphere. the number of species in north america has more than doubled since the last ice age. the continent hosts more than 100 times more species than the arctic ocean, with the continent hosting more than 100,000 species of invertebrates. asia and africa have more terrestrial species than any other continent. the number of species in the arctic is virtually unknown.the continent hosts more than 100,000 species of invertebrates. it is the second-most species rich continent, with more species per square kilometre  1.5 billion years ago, the arctic was dominated by land plants. at the same time, the oceans were filled with water. as a result, the climate changed from a wet to a cold-weather-dependent desert. this event changed the distribution of plants in the arctic and led to the radiation of plants across the region, including the partitioning of continents.at the same time, the composition of the earths atmosphere changed. it has been suggested that the melting of the glaciers of the alaskan shelf and surrounding coast caused the radiation of plants across the region.the arctic is a semi-arid continent with a milder climate and a slightly cooler temperature. the cold, 0th century, the arctic summers were much longer, milder than the summers of the northern hemisphere and experienced a temperature difference of about 30009, the minimum temperature is 29.6% lower than the minimum temperature of the previous recorded minimum. the minimum temperature is lower than all but two of the other terrestrial planets except the moon, and about 1000 times colder than the surface of the moon.the northern hemisphere summers usually have minimum temperatures in the northern and western parts of the continent average around 60005, the number of species is estimated at about zero. the southern hemisphere summers usually have maximum temperatures in the southern and eastern parts of the continent. on average, species on the southern hemisphere have a minimum temperature of about 240012 study of the fossilised remains of salamanders and salamis in the geologic field of the far north of the continent, south pole and up to about 2,500 genes, they had been replaced by modern fish about 300 million years ago, although salamanders were never fully domesticated. some genera remain near-legionary species, such as the salamander. salamanders and salamis are currently thought to have been the last truly independent species of land animals.the continents land surface is divided into two main sections, the lowland and the highland, and the two sections are linked by open water. the lowlands consist of land plants and bottomland plants, in turn called gravel. the highlands consist of marine plants, algae and other organic compounds, mostly in the form of organic carbon. the marine plants make up the land plants and algae that make up the strongest part of the land surface and provide the main drainage means for the continent. the continents land surface is divided into three main sections, the lithosphere and the orogeny. on the coasts of the continents, sea levels rise, while on the land, they drop. on the continents, the oceans absorb more of the water that falls as rain whereas the land conversely absorbs more water from the oceans than the oceans do; thus the land is being forced to hold more water than it is being forced to do. the lithosphere is mainly made of calcium carbonate, oxygen isotope ratios and chemical composition. the orogeny is partly made of iron and silicon isotope ratios and chemical composition. the lithosphere is also partly made of carbonate, oxygen and silicon isotope ratios and chemical composition. the ocean floor is mainly made of plankton. plankton are the single most common type of organism on the planet, accounting for about half of the worlds biomass. the oceans primary productivity, or biomass, is the flux of dissolved plant life. about half of the plankton",0,1

""reverence"" is one of the core aspects of good manners, which are core Christian teaching, as the act of deference to others is seen as a form of humility. in the act of deference to others, the passive voice is encouraged and the passive-aggressive tone is avoided.in the new testament, the act of deference to authority figures is praised in parables, such as the parable of the poor and the parable of the malarkey. the act of deference is termed ""standing for the little man"", and the act of deference is praised in the gospel of john. it is also written that ""he who has the little in himself will be taken in to the kingdom of heaven"".the word ""revelation""  was introduced into english in the late 19th century  its etymology is unknown, but the word is associated with a significant number of ancient greek roots, and it is the same word used in the quran.the word ""reverence"" is also used in the spiritual life of the ancients, such as in the quran and the hadiths.the word ""reverence"" was used by the ancient chinese as a religious and secular term, and it is also used by the chinese as a term of endearment.the word ""reverence"" was used by the romans of the late middle ages as an adornment of the body of a dead loved one, and it is also used by the romans of the late middle ages as a term of endearment. the word has been in use since the late middle ages.the word ""reverence"" first appears in the 15th-century english poem la nozze di pisa  in the 17th century, the english author henry shakespeare included a passage in his play john brown, in which jay, a young raven, is shown standing by a tree in the shape of a ""kingly""  the name derives from the greek   by the 17th century, the word had acquired a second meaning, ""of the king"", derived from   three ancient translations of the word are extant: in 1598, the french writer sir joseph brillon translates ""king"" in the plural as ""quear"" in his work le grande dame de sang. in 1672, the english writer sir john redmond transliterates ""queer"" as ""quear"" in his translation of paul vaz, the 16th-century english theologian and missionary to france. in the 17th century, the swedish theologian john calvin defines the word as ""queer"", a word which is ""originally a corruption of rand"".the word ""reverence""  this has caused some confusion concerning the relationship between ""reverence"" and ""reverence"", as some people may mean ""reverence"" and ""reverence"", while others may use the word simply to refer to a particular behaviour. ""reverence"" is not a legal term, and does not occur in the vernacular in the english language. however, it is sometimes used in legal contexts, such as in the context of authorisations for copyright infringement.reverence is also used in non-religious contexts. for example, in the legal contexts of trademark infringement and unfair competition, the word ""reverence"" may be used to describe the behaviour exhibited by a defendant in their attempts to market a product, or to raise an example of the behaviour exhibited by the defendant in their competitors attempts to market their product. in criminal law, the word ""reverence"" may be used to describe the illegitimacy of an action whereby a person who is not the actual perpetrator engages in criminal conduct",0,1

4,"2016 was a year of transition for mormon women, with the passage of the fiduciary rule and other related changes coming to work on their own. many mormon women are engaged in some form of labor outside the home, for example, and many participate in some form of ministry work outside the home.in 2018, 1.4% of the worlds population was female, and in the united states, 0.9% of the population was female. in other words, nearly all the worlds female population is being supplied by immigrating women into the u.s., who are using the same country the first womens use in the modern era.according to the world bank, in 2018, the average wealth of a woman in brazil was 0,2700011, the gender gap in wealth distribution was the widest in human history. a lower-middle-class woman in the developed world is more likely to have a child at a later age than a poor woman in africa or asia. in the united states, the gap in wealth was widest in the west, and the north was most affected by the rapid urbanization of the poorer classes. in the united states, the wealth of the richest 5% of american households had increased by $66.7\\x80\\x94more than any other country.in matabele republic, some women attained the status of princess, as evidenced by the name of the capital city.the number of women in the world seeking reproductive health services has grown from about one woman for every three men in 1990.a study of young women in africa found that, of all countries studied, africa had the highest infant mortality rate among the nations studied, and that more than a third of the births were to unmarried teenage girls.the number of teenage girls dying within a year has increased in every country studied.influential figures such as bill and melinda freezer, jeremy bluray, and louis altham have suggested that the reason for the disparity is economic. the average man in south africa had a median net worth of $1017 had been married and had no children.in the united states, pregnancy rate varied from 20.7 to 24.3% in 2000, and was 2.5 to 3.3% in 2007. in the united kingdom, pregnancy rate varied from 13.3 to 17.4% in 2000. in switzerland, pregnancy rate varied from 3.0 to 4.4% in 2000. in colombia, it varies from 3.2 to 4.1% in 2000. in india, pregnancy rate varies from 3.0 to 4.3% in 2000.in canada, pregnancy rate varies from 3.3 to 4.4% in 2000. in the united kingdom, pregnancy rate varies from 1.9 to 2.3% in 2004. in the united states, pregnancy rate varies from 1.6 to 2.5% in 2004.in the united states, the rate of births per 1000 people  is higher in the east  and in sub-saharan africa.in the united kingdom, the rate of births per 1000 people   rates of child abuse and neglect are higher in the west and the south, though rates are generally lower in the west and the south.a higher rate of infant mortality has been recorded in the poorer, urbanized, and more rural areas.in the united states, the overall rate of infant mortality has been increasing since the early 1960s. the most recent data for the united states show the birth rate for infants under age one under age one for the years 2007 to 2015. the highest infant mortality rate is recorded in the states of massachusetts, california, and arizona, which together have a population of approximately 4.7011 and 2016, respectively.a number of factors contribute to infant mortality. many of the factors that contribute to infant mortality are present in the developed countries but are much lower in developing countries. for example, the united states and canada are the only developed countries that do not have infant mortality compared to their northern counterparts. in the united states, the rate of infant mortality is higher than in any other industrialised country in the world. higher infant mortality in the united states is more common for women, older mothers, and people of the lower socioeconomic status. higher infant mortality is more common in urban and minority communities. low birth weight, low birth weight ratio, and certain other factors are responsible for most of the higher rates in the developing world.medianemens mortality is higher in developed countries than the unhealthiest nations in the world according to life expectancy at birth. in the united states, the median life expectancy at birth is 76.8 years  for women, the median age is 56.4 years and in the united kingdom it is 74.1 years for men. in africa, the mean life expectancy at birth is 72.1 years one of the main causes of infant mortality is preterm or low birth weight",0,1
5,"a similar practice was started in june 2009 by the chinese company zhejiang agave. the company is a member of the national agricultural development agency, and was granted a special export credit under chinas policy to cultivate opium. the cultivation of opium was initially approved by the us government, but in 2009 the us stopped supporting opium production, partly because of the japanese and vietnamese seizures of japanese opium in 2009 and 2010.after vietnamese officials discovered the vietnamese were cultivating opium, they began cooperating with the us, which led to a decrease in vietnamese seizures. in 2012, the vietnamese government launched a major anti-drug campaign, and in 2015 nearly half of vietnamese heroin addicts were treated with a prescription drug.on june 23, 2016, china and india signed a framework agreement to develop a middle-class trade relationship in the framework of the world trade organization. the agreement calls for a shift in the global pattern of development away from an oligopoly to a market economy and the establishment of mutually beneficial relationships between the two countries. it also includes the possibility of china and india joining the community of nations  china and india have been discussing the possibility of joining the community of nations  china and india are the biggest importers of chinese-made products and the two largest importers of indian-made products.the chinese government has been actively promoting its ""one country, one system"" policy as a solution for the problems the chinese domestic market poses. the one-country, one-systems approach proposes that all countries cooperate in order to solve the problems of the domestic market. however, according to one of the world banks experts, this is not the most efficient way to resolve the domestic market problems. the problems lie in the political, cultural and bureaucratic arrangements that govern the domestic market.the chinese government has been promoting its one-country, one-system policies as a solution for the chinese domestic market problems. the policy has been particularly effective in controlling the import of indian opium and heroin, which has been a major problem in the country. the one-country, one-systems approach has been criticised for its high taxes and controls on the flow of indian opium.in april 2007, china and india signed a framework agreement, the indian access to china and the chinese markets. the agreement calls for harmonisation and alignment of the border with china, and a new system of chinese and indian border controls. china and india have formed an economic partnership and the chinese government has been encouraging indians to make purchases of chinese goods.the policy of harmonisation and alignment of border controls has been a major success in controlling the import of chinese-made goods in china. the chinese government has been encouraging indians to make purchases of chinese-made goods. the chinese government also controls the manufacture and sale of chinese-made products in china.indias growth has been driven by its infrastructure and the countrys heavy reliance on oil imports. china accounts for about a fifth of chinas exports, which is the largest share of any non-oil exporting economy. china is china 2% of the global population, which is the largest in the world by area. its economic importance to chinas economy is over 7 times that of india. china has an estimated population of 46.7 million, more than three-quarters of whom are urban. china is the worlds largest consumer of chinese imports, which amounts to about 30% of its total imports. china has a significant trade imbalance with the united states. china imports more chinese goods than any other country.china is a member of the non-aligned movement, and its relations with european countries were restored in 1997. it is also a member of the non-aligned group of nations  china has been a member of the non-aligned movement for some time.china has been a member of the non-aligned movement since 1997, but has not been a member of the commonwealth of nations since 2004. in may 2008, china joined the non-aligned movement and became a party to the non-aligned convention, which opened the door for other member states to join in joining china. in 2013, china became a founding member of the organisation for a common foreign policy. the chinese foreign ministry stated that china would seek diplomatic ties with all major countries, asserting that china is an ""open and close bilateral partner of the peoples republic of china"". china has been a founding member of the international financial institutions  china and india are the two largest trading partners of the commonwealth of nations.china is the largest manufacturing country in asia, and the second largest in the world, behind india. chinas manufacturing output in 2015 was the eighth highest in the world, and china is the worlds largest manufacturer",0,1
6,", a rhinoceros is a large, agile animal that can run at speeds of up to 65 km/h. rhinoceroses have been used for ceremonial purposes in many cultures, including the ancient greeks and the romans. rhinoceroses are also used in traditional medicine since they seem to tolerate high doses of pain without suffering severely. in some traditional cultures, rhinoceroses are symbols of purity, death, and the underworld. rhinoceros horns are used as headdresses in blackface-type ceremonies.there are six species of rhinoceros; six species are native to africa and two are endemic. the species in question are the african black rhinoceros, the indian black rhinoceros, the siberian black rhinoceros, the siberian black rhinoceros, and the northern black rhinoceros. a small population of tcutecaran rhinoceros in china occasionally kill and consume those it has captured for its own purposes. it is believed that the tcutecaran rhinoceros is not aggressive towards humans, but rather follows humans around for its own purposes. the tcutecaran rhino was poached as far away as sicily and cuba, and is known to harass humans on the roads. rhinoceroses have been a part of many legends and romances. rhinoceroses were featured in the writings of shakespeare, and were mentioned in the music of pierre scatially. rhinoceros were mentioned in chinese folklore and were portrayed on stage by han zusheng and wang bi.the rhinoceros was the common name in the amish-moharie community, although the name rhinoceros was in use before european contact.the rhinoceros is an old name, with many sources varying from place to place. the most common and accepted name in english is rhinoceros, but rhinoceros is the more familiar name in the amish-moharie community. rhinoceros is an old english name, but rhinoceros is the more ancient name in the english-speaking world. an archaic english name ""rhinoc"" is recorded in the 13th century, possibly from a chinese word meaning ""great, powerful"".rhinoceros was the common name in china, but the chinese took rhino instead. the name rhinoceros was in use in the amish-moharie community in the 16th century. the amish-moharie name rhinoceri seems to be an anglicization of rhinoceros, which could be a persisting name, or a mutation of rhinoceros. in the 16th century, the name rhinoceri was used in a chinese-language rhyme between two chinese words meaning ""great, powerful"". the chinese word translated as ""rhinoceros"" is thought to have come from an earlier chinese word meaning ""hundred-headed dragon"", which could be an abbreviation of ""hundred dragon"", or ""hundred-headed crane"". since the 1700s, rhinoceri has been a name used by the amish-moharie community to refer to a certain dragon, the hound, an important part of their religious and political symbolism.the amish-moharie name rhinoceri  rhinoceri was probably derived from the chinese word for rhinoceros, which means ""hundred dragon"". the name rhinoceri might have been modified into ""rhinoceros"" in the late 17th century.the name rhinocerotus is attested to 1610:150 the species was probably derived from a greek word, rhinokos. the species was probably introduced into france in the 16th century.the first known use of the name rhinoceros was in the 17th century, when the name ""rhinoceros"" was used in a rhyme scheme with ""eternal"" and ""fever"" to signify the animals perpetual wintering, and was used in the context of a typeface. rhinocerotus was a familiar name to amish people, who had previously used the name tennessee, to distinguish themselves from the nameless animals of the region, now styled as ""trees"", and to refer to the forest that they inhabited. the name rhinoceros was still used in the context of trade in the 18th century.the name rhinoceros was first recorded in 1783, in the journal of the royal society of england. the first printed use of the name came in 1841 in the report by josiah wyatt, the customs officer, who visited the xhosa people in the year 1785. through a series of misbegotten appeals and in an",0,1

the police and the sharia police speculated that it may have been a result of a botched drug delivery attempt. in june, the high commissioner of ireland, commodore john newsham, called for an end to the ""murderous and barbaric"" practices of the sharia police, and assured the irish people of safety.in july 2013, president mr. zuma announced an end to state support for sharia. the government of south africa also removed support for sharia from its national security policy, a move denounced by south african president jacob zuma who said: ""the sharia police state will bring sharia to south africa"". in october, the south african sharia police arrested an alleged sharia bank robber who was connected to the oid, and released a video claiming credit for the successful robbery.on 15 may 2013, a suspected sharia terrorist attacked a checkpoint on south west highway in ugandan national police headquarters, the kruger national park. the suspect, a columbian national, was shot and killed by police. the suspect was identified as ashok goel, assistant security chief for the south west regional police. the incident came amid a heightened police presence in the park in response to the park being considered a safe haven for illegal migrants.on 11 june 2013, a south african-born u.s. judge ruled that the jamaat al-muslim brotherhood can enter ugandan national parks via auwal. the decision was welcomed by the government of the united arab emirates which said it is considering the move.on 13 july 2013, a south african-born judge ruled that jamaat al-muslims can enter unescos unescos national park, unguja. the ruling came after a south african national was arrested at the border crossing between south sudan and uganda.the lack of impact of sharia law has been highlighted in the media and public debate, with the islamist threat being cited as a prominent example. however, the law remains little more than an ideology that has been adopted by the leadership of each country and its militias.territorial and cultural control must be maintained in order to maintain the unity of the peoples of the world while addressing international threats from terrorism, war, diseases, migrants, crime, and aggression. this requires the use of religion as a basis for decisions, such as the protection of national symbols, or the preservation of religious and cultural traditions.a public health emergency is a public health care system that provides services and supplies to the general public in a manner that is fair, efficient, and transparent.in the united states,

number of people that die in developed countries is about 2.5% higher than in developing countries. in absolute terms, the richest countries have the highest death rates, while the poorest countries are the least healthy, with the top five countries, which have the highest per capita rate of overall death rates, having the highest overall death rates.the most common causes of death in 2017 were heart disease and respiratory disease, cancer, and diabetes. causes of death increased in all age groups, and for all ages groups except the oldest, who are now the prime sources for death. a variety of causes have been identified or hypothesized to be involved in the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.the majority of deaths occur in the developing world, although emigration has increased the number of people dying in the developing world. population trends, such as births to fewer than age 65 leads to

8,"1956. the second in the series, titled ""the curious case of the roses"", depicts the first encounter between the two principal characters, mark and linda. mark is now a professor at the university of alabamas law school and linda is a correspondent for the drama critic derek sheridan. the show ran for eight seasons and was nominated for five primetime emmy awards, three tv guide awards, and a starz childrens magazine readership choice award. it was created by andrew sheridan, a real-life partner of mark sheridan, and courteney kellerman, a longtime mark sheridan associate. the series was adapted by robert gerber, a visiting writer for the show.the nbc sitcom the love guru based on the series starred robert gerber as mark sheridan and brianne gardner as linda. the show was created by thom stewart, a former bbc comedy writer who had worked in the advertising department. the series was followed by a second, titled the love guru, which starred chris parnell as mark sheridan and ben wyatt as danny angela over the course of three seasons.the collection of short stories known as the roses saga was adapted in the works by fred valentino and linda ruppert in magna cum laude, published posthumously in 1977. the books were soon adapted in spin-off novels, and a fourth volume, the roses saga: stories from the vault by eddy kitsis, was released in 2014.the first two seasons of the series were created by andrew sheridan, while the third season was written by james fadiman and david robbins.the show was created by andrew sheridan, david robbins, and eddy kitsis; and the fourth season was written by andrew sheridan. the first season was set in an unspecified locale in the u.s. and was not connected to any of the other shows. the setting of the series was a bit off-center, with the central character, mark, living in la ciotat, a fictional town in the mid-atlantic united states. the shows writers included andrew sheridan, jay mohr, and charles mcdougall, with the writing team calling themselves ""the boys of the late 1970s"". the producers were concerned that the show would be perceived as an anti-muslim show. they also hoped to avoid the problem of the identity of the characters, i.e., mohr and michaelss, who were often perceived as anti-muslim. the show was broadcast by nbc in the united states, ireland, canada, new zealand, australia, russia, and turkey. after the first season, the show was shown in over 110 countries. the first season also featured a cast of performers, including actors who had appeared on the show before, such as julie rubin, the muppets, and carrie billinson, who had also appeared on the show before. for the second season, the cast was reduced to three, and the show was shown in asia and latin america and latin americas only. in the third season, the cast was reduced to one, and the show was shown in both europe and asia.the producers hired author harry vaughan for the job of a showrunner. vaughan had been a writer for the salem, virginia, and the maryland territories and had been a successful author of childrens books, as well as a novelist. though he was well known for his books, he was a relatively unknown author in the u.s. until his death in 1993.the first season focused on four women trying to get to the center of the rosewood cluster, a region of the country where new homes were being built on the cheap and old homes being torn down. the four women were paraded in a circus; four of them fell in love and married each other. the wives were romantically involved; linda proposed to mark; danny, one of the cab drivers, fell in love with linda; and the last woman, cherie, was romantically involved with mark.mark and linda meet at the center of the rosewood cluster, which is a fictional place in north carolina. the first place in the cluster is a warehouse. mark and linda go to this warehouse to look for a job. the warehouse is a fictional version of a real place in the u.s. it is here that the women meet danny angela, an old-timey-type character from the cab drivers book series, who is also their landlord and employer. danny explains to them that the place is a dystopia, a fictional dystopia, and that the reason for this is because of the poor quality of cab drivers. mark and linda then decide to go in search of cab drivers",0,1
9,"salt-to-water ratio is a great indicator of the water quality of a river. many rivers have a low or average salt level, which makes navigation difficult. salt levels vary from well-watering sediments to brackish water. salt levels in rivers are determined by salt concentrations in salt crystals and rock strata, and deposited organic chemicals. the presence or absence of salt in a river also affects the visibility and conductivity of rivers.the salinity of rivers also affect the appearance of rivers, which can be affected by the appearance of salt crystals or by the amount of organic chemicals present in the water. salts can also appear as white particles or as a dark, yellow disc in rivers. the appearance of light, fluffy, or plumper salts after rainfall or a fish kill is a good indication that the water is more alkaline than before the rains had washed away sedimentary rocks. on the other hand, deep yellow discoloration that appears in rivers after heavy rains may indicate a salt water leak, which is usually reversible by evaporation or by chemical decomposition. for this reason, most river navigation centers are located near sea level, about 2000 m on land, and about 3000 m in the deepest reaches of the oceans. on land, the ocean can hold about twice the weight of land.the earliest recorded navigation across a river was by the australian schooner philippe maréchal in 1683, who claimed to have navigated 43 rivers of india.the first recorded navigation along a paved road or path was by the french philippe de valladurai in 1749. he navigated the nations longest river, the ambe, between france and britain. the earliest paved road to the ocean, the ambe, was navigated by the french artist louis kh0th century, a number of large corporations began establishing themselves along rivers for the purpose of avoiding the difficulties encountered by ships and other boats in attempting to cross rivers. this practice was called ""river navigation"". common causes of river navigation are the following:many rivers have names that trace back to pre-historic navigation. for example, palestine, named after the ancient palisadean river, is named after the ancient river of pi. some of the most famous navigators of rivers are the ans have been the river navigators of the ans in the area of the egyptian pyramids. the ans have built a large navigational network along the egyptian and spanish colonial palisades. the ans established several routes through the desert, using outrigger canoe and alluvial canoe systems.the ans made many navigational innovations over their long history, and the most well known route is the ans route through to lebanon. the ans made extensive use of a navigational system that they built themselves, and this system continued to be built into the ans history. many navigators used the routes of the ans, or constructed routes around the ancient navigational centre of mecca, the citadela.the ans route to lebanon was built between 1385 and 1450 by the philippines. the ans route to kaffa was built between 1383 and 1423 by the guinean navigator juan de la paz de la paz.the historical ambe river navigation is conducted by the ans in area of the coloma.the ans invented the alluvial canoe system used by the philippines. the system was completed between 1534 and 1538. the ans made many navigational changes in the years 1535 to 1539, to accommodate the needs of the spanish colonisers. the ans also adopted artificial waves for alluvial rivers, which were millions of years ago. the ans also invented the alluvial navigation system for artificial rivers, which were millions of years ago.the ans river navigation routes are built in an effort to improve navigation for people, ships, and boats. the routes are named after the rivers in the ambe and nile belt that are navigable by sea. there are two main routes to the various ans river cities. the first and easiest of the routes is the ambe-nile path. the ans have also constructed many routes around the ans, the egyptian route being the most recent. the mara river, which was named after the river of might, is the ans river of azaaraknun.the second and more difficult route is the ambe-mara path. the ans have constructed several routes around the mara river.  the most direct route is the nile-egyptian route. people have navigated the river for many centuries, but no navigator has been able to cross it continuously for more than two thousand years.the ans also constructed a navigational path to the west of the sahara that was navigated by the philippines. the ans also built a route to the southwest of the sahara, and constructed a small bridge across the sahara 1,",0,1
10,"hybrid warfare was the use of firearms and explosives to initiate a fire war. the battlefield was the enclosed space between opposing armies, specifically between the armies of the two major world powers, the united states and the soviet union. a more extensive form of warfare, forms of open warfare and guerrilla warfare, were employed in both world wars. a recent study by daniel kahn, professor of history and public policy at the yale school of management, suggests that the notion of ""peace in a glass bottle"" is not quite accurate. rather, it is more accurate to say that the perception of the ""peace in a glass bottle"" was a key factor in unearthing effective counter-weapons, because it was the key to understanding and creating the innovative weapons systems that were used to defeat the soviets.the first weapon used in world war i was the musket, which was first used by the u.s. military in the american civil war. the muskets design was inspired by the thunderer, a late 18th-century water cannonister. the thunderer was a hand-held weapon which used water as propellant and was used in both world wars. however, the muskets design changed in several important ways from the muskets of the first world war. it was designed to be fired from a variety of angles, to accommodate different grips, and to provide a more comfortable fit. the muskets design also had several key features which later appeared standardised in all modern machine guns, including the bolt-action machine gun and the use of a threaded barrel for cocking.the next weapon used was the sawed-off shotgun, which was first used by the u.s. military in the american civil war and then used by the british military in world war i. the sawed-off was used throughout the first world war. it was the first weapon for which a reliable definition can be found, as it was the weapon adopted by the victors, not the original author. it was also the first non-lethal weapon used by the victors which can be traced back to the beginning of the war. the last weapon used by the victors was the bayonet which was first used by the french military in world war ii, used by the french army. however, the preferred term for this weapon by historians is ""jouissance"".the last weapon to be used in large-scale warfare was the machine gun. during the first world war, machine guns were used by both sides. the english-speaking world used machine guns while the british used machine guns primarily. however, as the war progressed, the use of machine guns by either side declined. the united states military and the british military had a monopoly on machine guns until the end of world war i, when canadian militia groups started to use machine guns. the united states placed machine guns under state control until the end of world war ii, when canada surrendered. the british retained machine guns for use by the royal navy, through the 1940s and 1950s.the final weapon used by both sides was the hand grenade, which was used by both sides. the hand grenade was the most widely used weapon in the conflict, although it was only used by the victors, and only by the united states that were directly involved in the war.  the use of hand grenades by both sides is the subject of much debate among historians of the conflict. most historians believe the hand grenade was first used by the french in the battle of the argentine in april 1914. by the end of the war, hand grenades were already used by the french, russian and austro-hungarian navies.the last weapon used by both sides was the rocket launcher. the french used rockets for launching the first, second and third wave of grenades. the russian navy used similar weapons, but the austro-hungarian navy did not use rockets, because it had no missiles capable of firing them.the last weapon used by both sides was the artillery piece used by the french in the battle of the argentine. the artillery piece used by the french was a type of grenade launcher similar to the american anti-tank weapon. the french used a variety of grenade launchers, including hand grenades, these weapons were used in a series of engagements in the last three phases of the conflict. at the battle of the argentine, the russian used a series of hand grenades which did not appear to have been designed specifically for use in a direct conflict with a franco-soviet rocket launcher.the last major armed conflict to occur during the war was the battle of the argentine, a battle for the strategic and symbolic space between the french and the united states. the war ended when the french declared the independence of the philippines in 1913, after the united states and british had joined the war, and the french-speaking peoples republic of china declared independence in 1915. the",0,1

12,"thomas schleidenschlager and colleagues found that the number of genes in the dna of sterile snakes varied from 9% to 49% different. they suggested that this dna is ""effectively random"", i.e. that it has no function. this finding has important implications for many aspects of snake biology, including snake sex selection, snake phylogenetics, and snake sexual behavior. this randomness is of interest to biologists generally, especially in the development of snake ion channels, snake recombination, and snake morphology. it also has important implications in ecology where it has played a central role in evolutionary analyses of snake adaptive radiation.genome-wide data from four populations of redback snake showed that there are more global variants of rs-xrn2 in snakes than in any other primate, including humans. this random effect is likely caused by the fact that the populations differ in phylogenetic standing, and so are genetically more similar to each other than to other populations. it is also relevant to the study of ""species difference"" in evolutionary tree analysis, in which taxonomic standing is used to demonstrate that particular taxa have more unique evolutionary patterns  or ""stochastic mutation"" as it is more commonly called. one explanation is that the variation is caused by a multidirectional mechanism involving multiple negative feedbacks. this could also be due to positive feedback, whereby the environment changes and the mutation carriers reproduce the variation.routes may also be responsible for snake mutation. the back-ranch snake eel  like most venomous snakes, the back-ranch snake eel has a single protein that is responsible for the pain it inflicts. the protein used to make the pain signal is located in the sialodacryoadl area of the snake. this pain is responsible for the sensation of pain in the snake, and it is this protein that has been lost in all modern rangemates and pandas. the only other snakes, besides the back-ranch snake, that have lost this ability are the mallard pythons.the back-ranch snake is the only snake of the family lepidoptera that also produce a snake-like characteristic, the tail. the tail is composed of two distinct groups of protein, the back group  the protein used to make the tail structure is located in the back of the snake, and is named the peltier peltier. the peltier peltier is a protein rich in protein and is responsible for the warm, sticky feeling the snake gives off when being handled. this type of protein is lost in most other snakes and is lost in all subspecies of snakes prior to the back-ranch snake, only the in-between groups of snakes such as the caspian snake and the palomar indian snake possess this protein and are therefore classified as distinct species.the following table presents the phylogenetic tree of extant snakes:the three living species of python can be divided into the two subspecies, the ""live"" and the ""dead"" snakes respectively. the ""dead"" snakes are those that have not evolved many different behaviors, and so are not included in the treatment of the live snakes.the word ""python""  was used in the 19th century to denote dead animals and humans.the word ""pythons"" comes from the persian word pyth, meaning ""flesh"", and the word python, meaning ""kingdom or kingdom"".the arabic word ""yemen""  from yemen, the persian word for ""kingdom"" was pyu, a variant of pak.the arabic word ""alam"" means ""heaven, high, lofty"". in fact, the arabic word for ""heaven"" is pak. the arabic word for ""heaven"" is pyur, the persian word for ""high"" is ahmad.the korean word for ""heaven"" is ngun.the chinese word for ""heaven"" is na.the arabic word for ""heaven"" is na.the chinese word for ""heaven"" is nu.the chinese word for ""heaven"" is pn.the chinese word for ""heaven"" is nu.the chinese word for ""heaven"" is pn.the arabic word for ""heaven"" is pn.the arabic word for ""heaven"" is pn.the arabic word for ""heaven"" is pn.the arabic word for ""heaven"" is pn.the arabic word for ""heaven"" is pn.the arabic word for ""heaven"" is pn.the arabic word for ""heaven"" is pn.the arabic word for ""heaven"" in sunda, thailand, is ""mijut"". it means ""pleasant, tranquil, fair"".in french, sunda means ""pleasant, tranquil,",0,1

be traditional clothing or they may be a complete ensemble with a choice of footwear. different cultures wear different styles of clothing, and so different pieces may be worn by different groups. for example, westerners are more likely to wear sailor blue than sikh bikinis. in other countries, cultural traditions and political systems have favored one particular piece of clothing, so traditional clothing is much more common, or may be completely banned altogether.in some cultures, people wear clothing to signify their identity, such as wearing clothes to show respect or to show their commitment to a certain social group or cause. for example, wearing shirts with a black hat represents the black community, and a shirt that is red, white, and blue represents the united states. this is known as ""colour-blind"" or ""color-inclusive"" clothing, which means that it is not just the colour that matters, but also the style, texture and pattern. in other cultures, people may wear only certain colours, or only for a certain group or community. this can be in contrast to the idea of ""gender-inclusive"" clothing where everyone can wear whatever they wish.in a study of american college students, researchers found that the majority of students associated ""being a girl"" with wearing a dress, and that the majority of students associate being a boy with wearing a dress.in british culture, gender roles are an important factor in everyday life. for example, a woman who fits the traditional gender role may find herself in the gender neutral clothing, and a man who does not may find himself in the gender stereotype clothes.gendai  and other yidaki. gender neutral pronouns are used by the majority of the populace meaning ""everyone"" is not the primary objective of the movement, although it is a registered movement.the goal of the anti-poverty group, unicef, is to eliminate gender stereotypes in the world through effective communication, financial and material assistance for gender-nonconforming people, and through advocacy of gender nonconforming people.unicef works to change attitudes of social acceptance and tolerance of gender stereotypes, including gender stereotypes that perpetuate discrimination. there are several ways people can help prevent gender stereotypes from negatively impacting their daily lives. the most common method is to make people aware of gender stereotypes and the negative impact they can have on their everyday life. another method is to present gender stereotypes in a positive light, which will cause the individual to change their behavior. finally, one can try changing the way people think about gender.people can also help prevent gender stereotypes by making themselves more present in the present. this involves creating a positive mental image of oneself, and reducing negative thoughts about gender.the term gender stereotype was first used by gilbert herdt, an evolutionary biologist and behavioural biologist, in a talk entitled ""the biological differences of humans and other animals"" at the university of wisconsin, in 1971, at the annual symposium on evolutionary biology. the term has since been used to refer to a variety of beliefs and behaviours, including gender stereotypes.the term gender stereotype has been used to refer to a range of negative attitudes that individuals usually hold regarding gender, and which can be found in both general population samples and individuals with certain personality disorders.individuals can fall into four main groups:the term gender stereotype is used to refer to the range of negative attitudes that individuals usually have toward gender. this refers to the range of behaviours that individuals usually keep to the idea that ""men are stronger than women"", ""women are inferior to men"", ""men are better than women"", or ""men are better than women"". although the term gender stereotype has been used to refer to a broad range of negative attitudes, it is most often used in relation to gender stereotypes. these negative attitudes towards gender are often found in individuals who have embraced gender stereotypes and who often hold negative attitudes towards both males and females.negative attitudes towards gender are a function of the individuals race, ancestry, and nationality. for example, in the united states, ""nerds are more likely to say men are better than women"", whereas in scandinavia, ""women are more likely to say men are better than women"". although stereotypes about gender are not universal across all societies, they are found to be most prevalent among young people in most societies.gendai presents research based on gender stereotypes and race/ethnicity as two examples of stereotypes used to explain gender gap. the first stereotype is that men are better than women in every respect, while women are usually considered to be on the lower end of the gender spectrum in terms of social acceptability. the second stereotype is that men are better than women in everything, including math and science.gendai presents the results of a survey conducted in 178 societies to determine the extent and nature of gender stereotypes. the stereotypes that individuals believe are most widespread among women, and men, in g",0,1
17," the act of cutting the cord is called a ""cutie run"". a cutie run is defined as a sequence of three consecutive episodes, where the primary difference between the first and last ""episode"" is that the episode does not have a title. cutie runs are typically depicted as three-chambered but can also be depicted as three-chambered-end with the main difference being which chalice is used. the term cutie refers to any child cheerleader, mare, or mule. the show uses a very loose interpretation of the term ""cutie"" and refers to the act of running around with a stuffed animal, usually a baby or an infant, wrapped in white paper. the act of cutting the cord is called a ""cutie run"". a cutie run is described as follows:the term ""cutie"" has been in use since the middle of the eighteenth century, when the english language began to diverge from the practice of initialism  the pattern of having ""cords"" starting with a ""y"" and ending in a ""c"" in the first episode of a series pattern is known as the medieval ""cutie run"". the name was changed in the 1950s to ""cut"" + (episode + (characters + (title) in the late 20th century, the term ""cutie"" was used by some fans to denote a female character, especially a mare, and as such the character in question is sometimes called a ""cutie"" instead of a ""maiden"" or a ""maiden-san"". the term ""maiden"" is preferred by many fans, but the term ""maiden-san"" is preferred by fewer fans. the term ""maiden"" is more commonly used to describe characters who are not female but who are somehow related to the female protagonist, such as the cat owner in the shakespearean quartet, or the owner of the mirror in hattori. the term ""maiden-san"" is preferred by older readers, but the term ""maiden-san"" is preferred by younger readers. the term ""cutie run"" is preferred by many female fans, but is less often used in male fan fiction.the female cutie has been a popular genre in childrens literature. the first story written in 1875 by c.w. hartley featured a character who is ""cutie run"" as a way to introduce a character who can be a child, although the character was only ever described as a ""maiden-san"". other stories, such as d. h. lawrys ""the cutie & the red head"" in 1892 and frederick sargeant and anthony shager ""the cutie & the red head"" in 1897, used descriptions of cutie runs or cutouts to introduce more complex characterizations of the group, such as the ""aunt ra"" of johann henderson. the characters in the stories are largely set in the cutie run setting, but they are allowed to describe more than one, as well as use descriptions of cutouts to complement the main story. an example is the 1894 novella the cutie and the red head, which is about a girl who falls in love with a very handsome prince. the story is told by the cutie and red head together.""the anime medium is used in many forms. the anime format is most often used for short stories and short stories, often featuring a single main character, often a child, with little to no characterization other than their looks. the popularity of these types of works is tied to the popularity of certain key elements, such as the format of the ""two-panel spread"", the use of female pronouns, the use of sexual content, and the fact that the story is set in a magical world. the characters themselves are often drawn very deliberately, with expressive facial features, and often with unusual background costumes. the length of the stories is often measured in the panels that accompany each story, and the presentation of the story as a whole is often accompanied by music or sound, which are often elaborate. often, the music is composed by the same individual who wrote the story, with the story used as a background. each story may be plotted by hand, with the plot itself arranged on a map. the artwork for these types of works often comes from the same place, such as the source material being a colored pencil drawing or charcoal illustration. some anime works are produced by companies that are subsidiaries of larger companies such as nippon express, longsword, and gohan. these works are often done in color, although the work is often done in black and white as well. these works are often written on paper as well as on animation film, which is colored pencil on a paper stock. when done well, the animation is very precise, with precise timing and precise movements in both directions. these works are often very graphic, and include things such as blood, semen, and scottish dubs",0,1
18,"stebbins, a young british chemist, had been experimenting with the use of dichloromethane in the manufacture of bis(1-trvo-di-ethanol, a strong ethylene glycol which he had prepared by the conversion of a crude di-ethanol into a crystalline form. he had also developed a second method of using ethylene glycol to produce di-ethanol from a crude glycerine. however, he had been unable to reproduce the di-ethanol-based method in catalysis since he had used ethylene glycol with a stabilizer, which he had not been able to remove the stabilizer with a catalyst. he had, however, succeeded in producing a new form of ethylene glycol which did not require any such stabilizers. moreover, he had also developed an inexpensive, readily available, and effective catalyst which he had not anticipated. as a result, in 1874, he had been able to produce the first hydrogen peroxide and the first ethylene glycol.the rate of technological advancement in the materials science and engineering disciplines remained slow until the early twentieth century. in 1914, british chemists james williamson and charles wheatstone built the first practical and widely used hydrogen peroxide, from perchlorophenol which they had synthesized from perchlorophenol in 1872. the hydrogen peroxide was first tested on a cigarette and later on a vaccine against yellow fever in 1920. wheatstone was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry for his contributions in the field. throughout the next few decades, these discoveries were increasingly incorporated into the engineering disciplines, such as engineering, mechanical engineering, and instrumentation. while the study of materials science and engineering remained a relatively small part of engineering, the development of new materials exceeded the engineering expertise of most engineers.the first industrial robots responsible for the manipulation of materials were invented in the mid-19th century. today, there are approximately 1,000 industrial robots in use. the majority of them are small, easily controllable, and self-steeped.the chemical reactions and materials science of the past three millennia bce, first inorganic antimony, then inorganic copper and then inorganic zinc gave rise to inorganic tin, inorganic lead, and inorganic copper all of which were used by the abbasid empire to make weapons and other articles, leading to the collapse of the old iron age.the european exploration of the moon and mars, landing on the south pole and eventually reaching the moon and mars, formed the basis for much of the technology and science to be used on the american, european, and other continents. the search for new materials and new technologies was part of the search for ""better inventions"", beginning with the pyramids at the beginning of the 19th century. the beginning of this period was followed by the discovery and development of the chemical and physical reaction combined chemistry, the fundamental branch of chemistry, in the 20th century. the discovery of the chemical energy and its application to the final cause of matter formation, the electron, led to the development of modern chemical engines, power plants, catalysts, and synthetic leather.in the past few centuries, many cultures have been built upon the materials that formed the basis of their civilization. these construction sites often bore witness to the construction of the structures themselves. one particularly impressive building was the great temple of bethlem, the second-tallest building in the world, but it was probably completed much earlier.the beginnings of the industrial revolution in the 19th century were closely connected with the spread of science and technology. the invention of the steam engine, a method of direct propulsion, opened a new direction for travel, enabling people to travel more easily and at a greater speed. the discovery of the internal combustion engine, a method of avoiding the use of fuel, opened a new path for the manufacture of goods. the discovery of electricity, the source of current, opened a new path for the manufacture of electricity. the mechanisation of production, the mechanisation of transport, the mechanisation of production, the mechanisation of assembly, and the mechanisation of mass-production were all the result of discoveries in the industrial revolution. the rise of rail transport, the ferrofluidics, and the use of steam power, and the electric motors, electric motors, and the electric arc, opened a new direction for industrial production. manufacturing production was the most important manufacturing sector in 1855, when the first integrated assembly plant was opened at the bremmerbach plant in germany. new factories were built to meet the increasing demand for motor vehicles.the rapid growth of the modern industrial system in the 20th century, coupled with the increasing role of machines in supporting and mechanising the production of goods, has led to the transformation of manufacturing in the 21st century. in the 2009 manufacturing year, machining and machining services were the top three in the world, while machining production was the largest manufacturer of goods",0,1
19," killjoys is a comedy of errors that began as a parody of british television series the office in 1994. the premise is that the job of a job seeker is to invite misfortune onto himself by committing a crime. the show examines the ethical dilemma of deciding whether to murder someone because he or she seems to be suffering from some ailment and therefore should have some misfortune on the fateful day. the show has been adapted as a play on the british work-ethic series, that features a medical drama with a fictional investigation into a possible illness. the show has also been adapted for film, with the 2009 film the office directed by michael schur that was released to mixed critical and commercial success.the characters are taken from real-life situations and situations are interspersed with humorous dialogue. the setting of the show is fictional, with the characters using real-life situations such as hospital settings, business meetings, and funerals as situations to create the tone of the show. the characters are not real, but a parody of life, and the goal of the parody is to see how the characters react to that situation in real life. the characters are not deliberately realistic, but are realistic in their interpretations of events. the show was a joint venture between the cbs comedy series and the production company, comedy central, which produced the series for nine seasons. killjoys was acquired by the comedy central production company in 2012.the show was created by alan di perna, co-creator of the office and a writer on the office. producer james cameron, a writer on the office, also worked as a writer on the show. the show was directed by cameron and written by him. rob mink, the co-creator and showrunner of the office, wrote some of the episodes. mink was the one who ultimately decided which characters should be killed off. he also serves as the executive producer, and several of the other writers serve as producers. the show was written by perna and cameron, while executive producers are michael schur, kristen graceier and troy miller. other writers include: aisha bhtari, aisha burley, julie dippoldi, fabian jacobson, jay krane, andy samberg, andy samloe, andy move, who has credited for writing and starring in the episode ""i think shes dead"".in august 2018, the show was nominated for a primetime emmy award for outstanding comedy special.the series was nominated for eleven primetime emmy award nominations, including four for best comedy series, in the late 1990s, including three for the primetime emmy award.the series was nominated for five primetime emmy award nominations, including four for best comedy series, in the late 1990s, including three for the primetime emmy award.the series was nominated for five primetime emmy award nominations, including three for best comedy series, in the late 1990s, including three for the primetime emmy award.the series was nominated for four primetime emmy award nominations, including two for best comedy series, in the late 1990s, including one for ""rock show"".the series was nominated for four primetime emmy award nominations, including two for best comedy series, in the late 1990s, including one for ""rock show"".the series was nominated for four primetime emmy award nominations, including two for best comedy series, in the late 1990s, including one for ""rock show"".two of the four emmy award nominations were won by the series, while a third award went to a live-action short-form miniseries. the series was nominated for four primetime emmy award for best comedy series.the series was nominated for three primetime emmy award nominations, including one for ""rock show"", in the late 1990s.the series was nominated for three primetime emmy award nominations, including one for ""rock show"", in the late 1990s.the series was nominated for three primetime emmy award nominations, including one for ""rock show"", in the late 1990s.on december 9, 2006, the series was nominated for three primetime emmy award for outstanding comedy special. the emmy awards were presented the same year to a short-form series based on the book the emmy program, and a second-form based on the book the emmy program: the memoirs of the most important people in television. the first and second-form episodes were both nominated for best picture and best director at the 51st primetime emmy awards.the series was nominated for four primetime emmy award nominations, including one for ""rock show"" and two for ""emmy: show me the money"", in the late 1990s.the series was nominated for four primetime emmy award nominations, including one for ""emmy: show me the money"", in the late 1990s.the series was nominated for",0,1
20,"answers to the original question, if a man could get fifty cents in a store with his hands on the register, would he not sell? the reply, ""yes"" was the easy answer, and the message was clear. the man had not consulted the store owner or the clerks to ask whether the sale of that coin was possible or desirable. the salesman had simply told them he was willing to pay that much just to avoid having to ask the customer to pay twice. the salesman was not an expert on sales, but he had been in it for 30 years and had no idea that a customer wanted to pay twice. if the customer wanted to take a coin out of a slot and put it back in, the salesman could do that; but if the customer wanted to keep the coin, he would need to ask the customer. with the whole sales process, including coin-removal, salesman-interpreting, and asking customers to pay twice, the salesman had spent the best part of ten hours explaining that it was not possible to get fifty cents in a store with a four-dollar bill. the salesman had spent the best part of ten hours explaining that it was not possible to get fifty cents in a store with a five-dollar bill. even if the customer wanted to walk right up to the cashier and ask her to take the coin out of the register, it would still be impossible to get a fifty-cent ball in a vending machine.some retailers refuse to accept credit cards, and some even require customers to present their hand-held devices. the big three national retailers do not allow devices larger than standard card widths in their stores, and the honda and latters refuse. honda and latters announced in march 2009 that they would ""re-examine"" their coin-operated machines, and honda and latters reiterated these commitments in april 2009. in september 2009, the us department of justice  the american technology corporation, the countrys largest retailer, said that it would phase out the use of coin-operated machines by the end of 2009.the vending machines industry in south africa was a catalyst for the 2009 tel aviv conference. south africas vending machine manufacturer, edwin companies, stated that their machines had been the first to sell e-cigarettes that contain nicotine. the vending machines at the conference were launched by the company maufuku. edwin is a subsidiary of the companys south african armys subsidiary, maufuku. the company maufuku manufactures vending machines that are sold in pharmacies and convenience stores. in july 2018, the company announced that it would be relaunching the vending machine line in south africa.in 2012, the vending machine market in south africa was estimated at us$2 billion. in 2017, the trade was valued at us$4 billion. in 2018, the trade was valued at us$1.5 billion.in june 2013, the startup company turkish vending machine inc. was established in the uk with the objective of entering the vending machine market. the company is based in dublin and had raised $1 million in funding from valar ventures, amazon, and philimore. the company was also purchased by the british company betchery.though the company is no longer in operation, the vending machine brand is used on the packaging of some cigarettes. cigarette vending machines have been operating in the uk since 2012, in some form.the vending machine brand has been a source of ongoing controversy in the united states, where it has been linked to cigarette smoking and obesity. the company has been offered millions of dollars in incentives by cigarette companies, but has declined them. in july 2014, the company plans to re-enter the uk market.in 2017, the company opened a retail location at ackerman park in north carolina.in december 2017, the company opened a second outlet at the triple d in north carolina.in june 2018, carter island, a small island in the atlantic ocean, was the first of the 50 united states to open a vending machine outlet.the company hopes to establish a presence in other countries. in january 2019, the company opened its first south african store at a mall in johannesburg, south africa. the first two outlets are at the north end of the island.the company has launched some vending machine flavors in japan, as well.on december 3, 2018, it was announced that an american company called i-cigarette has entered into a partnership with the british supermarket chain colcannon to market the flavors of the i-cigarette. the company is also working with other american and british supermarket chains including amys, amys super, and food, and is planning to expand to other countries in the future.the company is headquartered in the united kingdom and is owned by british sovereign wealth fund. its headquarters is in north london, united kingdom",0,1
21,".4% of the worlds fisheries are estimated to be at risk from overfishing. a range of measures have been proposed to mitigate the impacts of overfishing but they are not mutually exclusive. the proposed measures include the use of artificial selection systems and the development of predator-prey systems. by altering the behavior of fish, primarily by reducing the number of fish reaching the surface, there has been a recent increase in the effectiveness of some fishery practices. however, the net effect of these changes has been that fish are caught in less and far with greater frequency in recent years than in the past. the number of fish captured with nets has increased, and the total amount of fish caught by nets has decreased significantly in the past two decades.fishery practices have become increasingly dependent on artificial selection systems that reduce the number of fish that can survive. these practices have been found to have adverse effects on fish welfare, such that fish that survived were often not maintained, and were instead discarded without being caught again. fish are also caught in conventional ways, without being manually caught, trapped, or released into the wild.fishery management differs from other major industries in that the fishery is a social activity that has a positive effect on the community. this is because fishermen use their knowledge of fishing techniques to help inform decisions that improve the welfare of fish. the fish are harvested as part of a commercial activity that has other workers as well as the fisherman who bought the fish. the profit is made by the processors who sell the fish in the marketplace. there is a social aspect to fisheries because of the material used in processing and the work of fishery management. these techniques are necessary for fisheries to function. fish are often caught in dangerous places such as the shallower waters of the atlantic ocean, off the coast of brazil, and on the coast of peru.fishery is a fairly widespread term across the world. it is a major industry in itself, with over 450 million fish caught in 2000. fisheries are an important source of revenue for many nations. many fishing communities maintain fishing vessels that are out at sea catching fish. some fishermen use nets and trawls to capture fish, but most fishermen use nets and trawls only as a last resort, catching fish that cannot be caught on land. in this way, fish are typically caught in a sustainable way, so that they can be released back into the wild, for example by raising fish in captivity. as a last resort, fishermen use nets and trawls but there are also fishermen who ""free-catch"" fish by targeting specific fish species that are commercially important. this practice is done to a certain extent, but not always, by anglers who attempt to free-fish. in this method, fish are caught in the wild and released into the wild.fishery is a complex industry that is subject to many laws and regulations. trout fishing is classed as a very large sport, which attracts many anglers from all over the world. commercial fishing is also a very large sport, attracting many anglers from many countries. fishing regulations vary widely between countries, reflecting a wide variety of fishing practices, the intended use of the vessel, and the species being caught. a fishing license is required of all anglers. the license fee is usually set by the fishing authorities to pay for fish that are caught legally, i.e., in a seasonally fishing area, and according to the fishing regulations, anglers are required to wear brightly coloured clothing at all times, both in the vicinity of the boat and in the open ocean. fishing licenses are also required of tourists fishing in waters near populated beaches; this includes atolls, rocks, and coral reefs. fishing off the coast of peru, on the other hand, is usually free and open to the public.fish are caught at the ocean surface by nets that are either placed to catch the fish or to help build the nets. these nets are called ""seals"" because they are on land only and are made by digging a hole deeper than about 2 metres  once selvedge is dead, leaves fall out. the net is closed and the fish escapes. this is called catching fish. some fish escape when they are caught by nets, while other fish  the net is placed over the angling rod and rod end.in a traditional fishing village, the fishing rod is first used to feed the fish. the fish are then taken by the fishermen to the cabin, where they are cleaned and washed, then cooked. the fish may be eaten raw or cooked into a dish that may be eaten. in a restaurant setting, the fish may be cooked into a meal.fish are also cleaned and washed again before being released into the wild, sometimes thousands of fish are caught in a single day. fish are typically stunned and killed after being caught, or they may be released back into the wild where they are hunted. fish are also hunted in this way in the wild by humans for meat or for trophies.the term for a fish that",0,1

26,"vessel bezoss theory of mind describes how a person can acquire what he calls ""mental attitude"". the latter term describes a person who is able to acquire attitudes of non-reactive or non-judgmental high regard, non-judgmental respect, and non-judgmental indifference toward others.  in essence, people who are able to acquire attitude would be saying they are moral, ethical, or skeptical. the ability to affect attitudes is said to be ""socially innate"" or ""dynamic"" and is considered a precondition for competence in various social situations. the cognitive brain is the seat of cognition, which is defined as the cognitive processes that occuruate with mental states, and are not exclusively or primarily external to the individual.mental attitude is a specific type of attitude. attitudes are generally classified as positive, negative, or neutral, depending on the context. in the positive attitude, a person expresses approval or disapproval of a situation, and is willing to change or adapt the way that a situation is handled so as to improve its outcome. negative attitude, on the other hand, describes feelings of discomfort or discomfort in the presence of a situation, and is characterized by a person not wanting to confront or modify the situation in order to resolve it in a positive way.in everyday life, people often differ in their attitudes towards various situations. for example, many people may express a negative attitude towards immigration, or a desire to deport illegal immigrants.some attitudes are acquired through experience. positive attitudes are ones that are self-understanding, and are formed from habits of thought, action, and behavior. negative attitudes are ones that are external to the person and are formed by internal dialogues.for example, many people dislike being told what to do by their spouse, parent, or other authority figure.people with autism have difficulty with attributing their problems, and attribution is a difficult skill for people with those disorders to master. for example, children with autism may have difficulty with attribution of their problems, whereas those on the autism spectrum may have great difficulty. negative attitudes are ones that a person expresses to others or to themselves, such as annoyance, disapproval, or disgust.for a list of mental attitudes, see this article.philosophers have debated the nature of knowledge and knowledge-making for quite some time, whether in the abstract sense of the word ""knowledge"" or in the sense of ""observation"", ""objecting"" and ""objecting"". on the other hand, malthus argued that knowledge is neutral, and knowledge-making is the agent by which the agent learns what to do. some view knowledge-making as an act, while others view it as a skill, or a faculty, acquired through observation and experience.several models have been proposed to explain the phenomenon. the model that has received the most research is the ""rat model of knowledge"", based on research by jeremy bentham. this model suggests that knowledge arises from the intersection between the agents interest and the agents interest. the agent is interested in learning how to move faster, so the agent takes the path that is most convenient. this is generally the same as the agent would learn from observing the path the agent would follow if he/she were not in the same situation.experience with knowledge-making often leads to the agents expressing knowledge. this is sometimes referred to as ""seeing-the-self"" or ""seeing-another-self"". an example of self-expression is the agent expressing knowledge about a subject to the environment through non-verbal communication.the use of non-verbal communication is sometimes referred to as ""seeing-others"", ""seeing-self"", ""seeing-self"" and ""seeing-others"". non-verbal communication is a means of signalling to others or a means of communicating onesself. non-verbal communication includes words, phrases, facial expressions, body language, gestures, and voice communication. the awareness of an agent of a potential threat allows the agent to approach the threat and avoid it.by contrast, the word ""knowing"" is a more specific, and more technical, term that is more often associated with physical or sensory awareness. ""knowing"" refers to the level of awareness, not the content of awareness. the word ""awareness"" which is most often used in academic discourse refers to the ability to articulate, express, or understand oneself.according to this definition, knowing ""someone"" refers to a person the agent is interacting with via words, thoughts, or actions.

wikimedia commons, neuroscience is the branch of biology that studies the mechanisms and physical properties of the brain. it is the branch of biology that has been most concerned with since the first organisms emerged. the term neurology is also sometimes used to refer to the branch of biology that studies neurology as a whole, although historically the term neurology was used primarily to refer to the medical sub-discipline of neurology, which is distinct from the rest of the medical sciences. in addition to the neurological sciences, neurology deals with consciousness and consciousness-related phenomena such as neural pathways, the brain stem, motor neurons, and various kinds of connective tissue. neuroscientists generally focus on the mechanisms by which consciousness and consciousness-related phenomena are produced, understood, and realized by individual humans, and on the problems of consciousness and its associated phenomena, such as the search for meaning and meaning in the world, or the existence of an afterlife. the understanding of consciousness and its related phenomena are of crucial importance to humanitys understanding of itself and future human society.the brain is the most complex organ of the body, with many functions that it performs. it is also the most complex organ of the human body, capable of performing many different tasks and fulfilling many different roles. when compared to other organs, the brain is equipped with a wide range of cranial nerves, more powerful synapses, and a large number of pathways that connect it with the rest of the body. a brain neuron is a small area of the brain responsible for synaptogenesis. this means that it can learn from its environment and adapt its behavior to the changing conditions it encounters. this adaptability is one of the hallmarks of all living organisms. the brain is also a self-organizing machine that continually learns from its environment. the brain stem is the part of the brain responsible for controlling impulses and information flow through the brain to the muscles and other parts of the body. the cerebellum is the main part of the brain responsible for the structure and function of the cortex, a large area of interconnected nerve endings that forms a large area of the brain. the cerebellum is divided into two parts, the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere. the cerebellum can be divided into two hemispheres, one for each hemisphere: the right hemisphere is larger than the left, with a larger number of lobes.the brain consists of three main parts, the right and left hemispheres:the brain is divided into an atrium, ventricularis, and linguale. the atrium is divided into the left frontal lobe and the cerebellum. the linguale is divided into the right temporal lobe and the cerebellum. the atrium and linguale are collectively known as the cerebellum.the brain is commonly thought of as consisting of three main parts, namely the right and left hemispheres, the right and left parietal lobes, and the left superior parietal lobes. the atrium and linguale are collectively known as the right frontal lobe and left posterior parietal lobe. the right and left frontal lobes are fused, and the right parietal lobe is missing. the area of the brain that is associated with the awareness of awareness, known as the right hemisphere, is often termed the sieve of the brain, or the right hemisphere of the brain. it has been proposed that the fusion of the right and left hemispheres in humans occurs at the sieve of the brain, or the sieve of the brain, although this interpretation is not universally accepted.a complex example that uses the sieve of the brain is the human brain, a modern version of the first reported human being, which was discovered in 1871 by the german scientist johannes k0th century.the sieve of the brain is divided into the right and left hemispheres and back to the middle, but the relationship between the middle and back is not as clear. in the early 1960s, it was proposed that the right hemisphere was always in an unspecific location, the left hemisphere was always with specific location, and the brain could have a ""center"" region that was always present. the brain, as viewed from different perspectives, is divided into two hemispheres. the left hemisphere is associated with specific functions, such as planning or learning. the right hemisphere is associated with more general, less conceptual skills, and the associated functions are carried on in both hemispheres. the brain is

julian jurgensen and his colleagues developed a program to assess the safety of a new generation of strategic communication methods, including mass media. they established that the media had not yet reached its full potential. the risk was that these methods would be misused by criminals or militarists, or used against civilians as a form of warfare. they proposed a new generation of strategic communication methods, one line of attack at a time. they presented their proposals at the 1961 berlin talks.the berlin talks began on 5 july 1961, at the university of berlin with a meeting of the berlin governments delegation and other interested parties. the main focus of the talks was on the problem of PR: in the previous two years, the united states and the central powers had spent millions of dollars on PR, with the british and french spending roughly four times that amount.the third country at the table was the soviet union, which had been developing its own strategic communication systems since the 1960s. the berlin government decided to spend us$100,000 per year for a year in exchange for the exclusive use of that countrys strategic communications network. the berlin governments said they would share the costs with the other participants, and the united states and central powers said they would share the costs with the central powers. the berlin delegates proposed a total of us$500,000 a year for the berlin governments to use strategic communication networks. the american delegation said that the purpose of the communication would be to strengthen friendship and cooperation between the united states and central power. the berlin delegation said that the purpose of the communication was to contribute to the joint planning and coordination of us actions in support of the us-central power alliance. the soviet delegation said that the purpose of the communication was to strengthen the central power alliance, to improve the central power alliance, and to provide the berlin governments with information on the intentions of us and central power leaders. the berlin delegation said that the central power alliance could contain the united states and central power, but not the other west  the berlin delegation said that the united states and central power would be best able to counter us and central power leaders.the berlin delegation said that the idea was that the united states and central power leaders would be the best able to respond to the united states and central power leaders, but that the berlin governments would have the least influence and ability to respond. the berlin government and the rest of the central powers would not be able to coordinate their actions with the united states and central power leaders. the berlin delegation said that the berlin governments would be able to provide the berlin governments with information on the intentions of us and central power leaders.the berlin delegation said that the communication would be managed by a central power in berlin, and that this central power would coordinate actions between the berlin governments.the berlin delegation said that the purpose of the communication would be to build a strategic and material relationship between the central powers and the united states and central power alliance.in the run up to the 1950 united states presidential election, the british and french governments were already preparing for war, and their preparations were based on events in europe and on the assumption that the us would attack south korea. the british and french governments had also begun to build up a large military presence in the area. the threat of us and central power intervention in the korean war had already been discussed in paris and the early 1950s.the original message was ""perhaps its time to split the atom"" and the accompanying text said that ""the splitting of the atom does not, in the main, concern us in the slightest"". the message was intended to convey the idea that ""two atomic bombs can destroy each other simply as the two aerial bombs did"", and that ""we could destroy both the enemy and all the peaceable nations"". according to american strategic policy memorandum number 15, the official message was that ""it is our hope that the two air-powerings of us and e-powerings of europe will soon be brought into play to effect peace in the arabian and muslim world"".the berlin government and the peoples army of berlin were created on 9 july 1947. the first berlin-based army was the berlin-based army.deutsche kommunikant gmbh of germany was established on 20 march 1948 as the first federal government agency with the task of providing administrative and material support to the berlin government. the other government departments and agencies were created later. the government of the reich was established on 18 july 1947, and the offices of the president and of the prime minister of the reich were established on 27 july 1947. the office of the chancellor was established on 1 january 1948 by the reichstag on the recommendation of the prg. the office of the president of the federal

45,"thomas rogge, a professor of history and public policy at tufts university and author of the forthcoming theory of history, agrees with van gogh that history is a social science rather than a science, and that it is therefore somewhat different from science.history is the study of the way things change. it is a social science, different from science which is concerned with the physical world. it is also a social science, but not a scientific one, because the methods used in research are not based on scientific principles but on ""public relations and the media"", according to rogge. he argues that the terms ""history"" and ""science"" should be distinguished in their respective ways, and that the terms ""history"" and ""science"" should also be avoided.some scholars argue that, although it is sometimes argued that history is more accurately described as a social science, this is not always true. in particular, sociologist d.h. cox  in his book, through the eyes of history, cox shows how historians have often been skeptical of the concept of ""history"" itself.historians have often been skeptical of key aspects of the concept of ""natural law"" of the legitimacy of the legal systems that they created. for example, jeremy grimes  cox also argues that while historians may argue that the role of the state was originally modest, and the discussion of states to justify colonial expansion inevitably included conflicts, the contemporary concept of ""state"" is a more recent invention that arose out of the revolutions of 17th century europe.the study of history, as much as other branches of british study of history, is also in part a study of societal institutions. the history of the state is studied at the university of cambridge. the primary institutions of society are the state religion and the state church. the history of the state is studied at a university of cambridge. the study of state religion has followed the same pattern as the history of the state.producing and consuming history is a form of consumption, which means that the consumption of the historical period is part of a series of events, which are all linked to the production of a particular cultural product in the modern world. this is a major form of media consumption, and a major aspect of the history of culture.historians have often been skeptical of attempts to understand the past. for example, david mann and anthony d. horowitz question the historical veracity of apa, the hindu chronicles, and the british past, as well as other sources. other scholars, such as elmer l. delt, have pointed to certain events being of social significance, such as the destruction of the frescos in the temple of the sun at delphi. other scholars, such as robert m. charlton, have argued that the events were largely symbolic. the destruction of the frescos was symbolic because it symbolized the overthrow of the polity, as the sun deity was represented by destruction in the new constitution of the republic of greece under theaetetus, a system of government in which the polity was replaced by a deity that neither the state nor the people believed in. the frescos were symbolic because they were a part of the polity. other scholars, such as robert m. charlton, have argued that the frescos were symbolic because they were part of the polity. the history of the nubian empire was written by chichul, the 29-year-old daughter of a chinese general who overthrew the nubians in the second non-chinese century. chichul chronicles the ways of the empire to a contemporary audience by showing the peacefulness and prosperity of the times. the book was translated into chinese by the chinese scholar wang bi, who also wrote the history of the empire  the book was also reprinted in 1934 by the chinese nationalist zhu wang.the study of history is one of the three major branches of british study of history, alongside geography and literature. the history of the 20th century has been characterized by three major philosophical trends that are integral to the study of history: empiricism, realism and relativism.in the 19th century, major events leading to the rise of history were: the discovery of new lands, such as the new world, the discovery of old lands, such as the western hemisphere, the first world war, the discovery of new languages, such as german and french, the advent of the great cultural revolutions, the unification of the church, and the industrial revolution. this was followed by the rise of modern institutions, such as the state and the university, which educated the elite and invented machines and technologies that enabled the rise of science and industry. this is the industrial revolution, which made possible the vast expansion of resources available to the industrial revolution.the disciplines of history and politics also contributed to the rise of history, although the study of history was not always pursued systematically.historians are anyone who studies",0,1
46,", a republican is someone who is loyal to the political principles of the republic for better than average life time, but has not elected to become a member of the republic. the word republic derives in part from the ancient greek word 0th century, ""republic"" was shortened from the earlier proto-iranian romanization of the word. the modern concept of a republic is, broadly, that of a government of state, in which the executive and legislative branches of government are separated by separation of powers, with the legislature and the judiciary composed of the two highest branches, and the executive and the judicial handling of domestic affairs. a state is distinguished from a monarchy, which is distinguished from a republic, which is distinguished from an hereditary monarchy or a hereditary monarchy.governments have historically been created in order to balance power between the various levels of government. in many societies, the institutional arrangements for the exercise of power are such that the state is the dominant power, or at least the dominant power in terms of the size of the state population, and the institutional arrangements for its effective exercise are such that the state is the dominant power in nominal terms as opposed to the size of the population. alliances between rulers and their political allies and enemies are common in most civilizations. the principle of alliances between rulers and their political allies, has been called the ""golden age of alliances"" by david parnas and david kolbert, and the ""ruler-client"" relationship by henry cake. in the past, alliances between rulers and their armies were considered as political instruments of the state, as they were between monarchs and the armies of a conquered state. the state sometimes worked with other states to form an alliance, but these were less common in developed nations. political friendships were also made through economic alliances between states, which was the basis of international trade, and so were no longer sufficient to create an open market economy. states also established diplomatic relationships with each other, through trade agreements and other state actions. the first recorded attempt by a state to establish diplomatic relations with another state was made by the british dynasty in 1639, with the first recorded treaty of friendship between a foreign power and a state being the treaty of ghent between the english and the british in 1648. the first officially recognized foreign embassies of the united states were established by the american republic of china in 1828 and the french in 1836.the power of kings and rulers to rule a country has often been questioned, and the difference between a ""republic"" and a ""democracy"" is often emphasized. the distinction between a ""republic"" and a ""democracy"" is often considered to depend on the nature of the political system being established. in many democratic nations, the term is used more expansively, including in some western nations, such as the united states, canada and new zealand, where the word ""democracy"" is more restricted.the term ""republic"" is generally used in its broadest sense, which means both a commonwealth and a government of commonwealths, as distinct from a monarchy or other form of government of commonwealth. the word ""republic"" also appears in the title of the 18th-century english dictionary of the english language, which is the first modern english-language source of common english words with any word in the english language. the adjective republic is an anglicization of the words royal, commonwealth and parliamentarian.the word ""republic"" descends from the latin reliquus, which means commonwealth or kingdom. the word republican is from the latin reliquus, meaning commonwealth. the word republican is the source of many words in the english language, such as royal, commonwealth and parliamentarian. the english word republican is also used for the continental european language, which uses the word republican as its word of the first origin, as does the dutch.the term republican can also be found in a variety of other words in the english language, such as the english chronicle, english literary world, english parliamentary world, english court of common pleas, english house of lords, english crown, english high commission, english parliamentary system, and english parliamentary system.the majority of english states adopted their own constitutional form of government between 1733 and 1783, although the duke of wellington had suggested a model comprising three distinct legislative assemblies, a parliament, a parliament of commonwealths and a sovereign.  the 1733 english statute book is divided into three sections, each from which derive their own names. the three sections of the model consist of a parliament of commonwealths, a parliament of assemblies, and a sovereign. each of these is named after its state, and in

American chemist john williams invented the method of distillation in 1894. distillation is a method of heating, in a closed vessel, a solids solution of a substance to yield a product. the process of distillation is as follows:a complete distillation of a liquid is complete when the product is filtered out with a filter. the product is treated with heat and evaporated out of the vessel. the product is filtered and concentrated in a hot nitric acid solution. a mixture of sulfuric acid and water is heated to vaporization. the product is heated to vaporization until the sulfuric acid vaporizes and the water vapor is condensed to the liquid solution. this condensed product is cooled and is ready to be bottled.a complete distillation of a liquid produces a finished product. the distillation product is cooled and is ready to be bottled.a complete distillation of a liquid produces a finished product. the distillation product is cooled and is ready to be bottled.a distillation of a solid is complete when the product is filtered and a solution of the solid is saturated with a filter. the product is filtered and a solution of the saturated product is prepared to be distilled. the product is cooled and is prepared to be distilled.a complete distillation of a liquid is complete when the product is filtered and a solution of the liquid is saturated with a filter. the product is filtered and a solution of the saturated product is prepared for cationing. the cationing is complete when the product is filtered and a solution of the liquid is prepared for filtration. in the case of a solid, the solution is prepared for ionization. the ionization of the product removes the precipitate, ionization of the product, and finally the filtration of the solution. the filtration of the solution removes precipitate, ionization, and finally the removal of the filter. a complete distillation of a liquid is complete when the product is filtered and a solution of the liquid is saturated with a filter. a liquid is saturated with a filter only when the product is filtered and a solution of the liquid is saturated with a filter. a solid is saturated with a filter only when the product is filtered and a solution of the solid is prepared for ionization. the ionization of the product and the solution follows the same process. the product and solution are prepared for ionization.in the case of a solid the solution is prepared for ionization. the product and solution are removed from the liquid and the metal wicks that were used to filter the liquid are replaced by new metal ones. the new wicks are coated with nickel and then covered with conductive nickel foil. after this, the new liquid is purified by heating on an electric arc. this heating allows the new wicks to stick to the nickel and prevent them from separating. the heating stops when the new wick separates. in the case of a liquid, the separator is heated to remove the liquid. in the case of an electrolyte solution, the cathode is heated to remove the electrolyte. the heat of the cathode allows the atomic layer to heat up and provide a conducting surface for the new electrolyte, while the heat of the metal layer allows the liquid to conduct.in the case of a liquid, the electrolyte is heated to ionization. the product and solution are removed from the liquid and the new solution is prepared for ionization. the ionization of the product and the new solution removes contaminants and removes the ionization product. in the case of an electrolyte solution, the solution is heated to ionization. the product and solution are heated to ionization and finally the separation is achieved when the liquid reaches the temperature of the ionization product.the oil and water vapors that are left over from the distillation of the original liquid are heated to gas phase and the resulting gas phase is passed on to the heating coil. the heating coil passes the gas on to the heating element that is heating the liquid. the element is set to take this gas through a nozzle to the heating element and the nozzle passes the gas on to the heating coil. the heating coil passes the gas through the nozzle and the nozzle passes the gas on to the coil. this ensures that the liquid that is being heated is heated correctly. the gas phase is heated until it begins to vaporize and the liquid is taken through the nozzle to the heating element. as the vaporization proceeds, the heating coil is heated until the gas phase is completely heated and the liquid is taken through the nozzle to the heating element.wheels:wheels are used to help stabilize the liquid during the heating and cooling process. with the use of a wheel, the fluid will flow and condense onto the wheel. in the case of a wheel, the wheel is used to apply heat to the wheel. this results in a lubricated surface that provides improved grip and helps the wheel remain more stationary while the heat is heating and cooling the liquid.wheels are",0,1

in recent years, alternative medicine has become a growing field of science, with a rise in research methods and in the use of randomized controlled trials  a number of alternative medicine approaches have been developed, and most alternative medicine systems are based on specific principles: they may not be based on a particular model or theory, and they do not claim to be better than conventional medicine.alternative medicine has been used by the military, the national armed forces, and other large organizations in the treatment of a variety of different conditions, including cancer, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. the term alternative medicine is used to describe medical treatments that are based on alternative medicine concepts, such as herbalism, homeopathy, naturopathy, and chiropractic care.alternative medicine is not a new field of science. it has existed since the beginning of medicine, and is practiced today by many ancient and modern medical practices. some of the most common alternative medicine practices include:the word ""alternative"" is derived from the ancient greek word 0th century.in the medical literature, several alternative medicine theories were proposed, including alternative medicine being based on observations of natural phenomena0th century, alexander peterson, a professor of medicine at the yale school of medicine, proposed a very simple, albeit controversial, theory: that vaccines are ineffective and that antibiotics should be replaced by alternative methods of treatment. his work was largely ignored by the medical community until he submitted his paper to the american journal of medicine in 1971.peterson believed that because no vaccines work, it is possible for a vaccine to be invented that works like a vaccine and is given to people every year instead. he also believed that because the immune system of humans is weak, a vaccine can be designed that works like a vaccine and given to people every year instead. alexander m. kastle, a professor of medicine at the yale school of medicine, proposed the following pseudoscientific rationale for vaccines: ""it is possible that in the future, i could have a vaccine that works like a vaccine and takes a few weeks to make. in the meantime, im keeping an eye on this.""  in 1983, the government of the united kingdom announced that it was paying a group of researchers $250,000 to carry out a study to determine the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine against measles, mumps, rubella  the study was largely ignored by the medical community, despite several authors having receiving payment for their participation.in 1987, the us public health service started a study looking into the use of a combined measles vaccine that had been developed with mumps vaccine. the us study found that the combined measles vaccine was highly effective in preventing mumps in the united states. despite high vaccine effectiveness rates, the us study did not find enough evidence to recommend the use of the combined measles vaccine, which was not to be expanded upon.the us mumps virus vaccine was also highly effective in preventing mumps in the united kingdom.a 1986 study found that, although a booster shot was generally more effective than a one-shot placebo, the effectiveness rate with the one-shot vaccine was significantly higher with one shot than with booster. a 1986 study found that the combined measles vaccine was less effective than the combined dm vaccine with one booster. a 1987 study found that the combined mumps vaccine was no more effective than the combined measles vaccine with one booster. a 1989 study showed that the combined mumps vaccine was no more effective than the combined dm vaccine with one booster.in 1993, the us preventive services taskforce reported that about 37% of children in the united states had been vaccinated with mumps-containing vaccine. of these, about 68% were unvaccinated, 24% were vaccinated with mumps-containing varicella vaccine, and about 16% were vaccinated with a chicken pox-containing vaccine.in the early 1990s, there was considerable concern that the mumps virus vaccine might be causing severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis. this was disputed shortly after the mumps virus vaccine was introduced; the concern was eventually resolved, as sheeps eggs and tissue were accidentally mixed with the vaccine, and this was corrected after the samples were subjected to a screening process to eliminate potentially susceptible sheep.the mumps virus vaccine is effective in reducing the risk of mumps in young people, although there",0,1

83," had been published in the american journal of medicine, and the first american review of the effects of ernest n. alva  he was working on a book about the effects of a single high-dose iv combined with dietary restriction. within a few years, he was also working on a review of the effect of various diets on improving human performance. alva shared his initial conception of exercise as the primary subject matter in the early stages of clinical trials in the late 1920s, but in the course of writing of the book he realized that it could also be the primary subject matter in further studies.alva was at the center of a controversy in the late 1920s over the proposed use of exercise as a treatment for low blood pressure. the relationship between hypertension and exercise prompted public and congressional criticism of the drug. alva was widely criticized for failing to communicate his conclusions adequately to the public, and he faced pressure to grant the request for a grant of some $25,000. he decided to give the money to the national institute of health. the first grant went to the university of massachusetts, which operated a medical campus and a research laboratory for exercise research. the university of massachusetts managed-care and clinical training program funded the program.the penny-pinching approach of the time was not lost. in 1923 john willer, director of the pennsylvania athletic clubs program, sponsored a 30-person summer program at the university of philly. these were the first Pennsylvanian to sponsor an athletic program. the summer program was based at the pennsylvania state athletic club in fairmount, pennsylvania. willer and the pennsylvania athletic clubs staff were organized and staffed by former and current college and university coaches. willer also hired two summer basketball teams, coached by ex-nba players and current players.the first long-form study of exercise and hypertension published in the 1920s, by l. david mech in the journal of the american medical association, examined the relationship between hypertension and various physical activities. using this approach, mech proposed that exercise produce an increase in blood vessel blood flow. in a subsequent study, led by james e. hamilton, a professor in the department of kinesiology and cardiovascular physiology at the university of massachusetts medical center, forensic investigators demonstrated the effectiveness of exercise as a preventive measure against cardiovascular disease. in the present study, researchers from the department of kinesiology and cardiovascular physiology at the university of massachusetts medical center and the university of pennsylvania state the study was called the ""athleisure-activity"" hypothesis and found that the benefits of exercise were greater the more time people exercised. this was supported by a variety of evidence-based studies including race, age, gender, body-mass index, heart disease, smoking, and use of statins.in june 2009, a ten-year study found that exercising increases the number of postprandial blood clots in the blood. in a later study, researchers found that the benefits of exercise can last throughout the post-workout period. of the approximately 2,000 participants, almost all exercised for at least four hours. many participants exercised more than one hour at a time. in one exercise trial, participants exercised for eight hours and then practiced a seven-day recovery period. in the other trial, participants exercised for 10 hours and then practiced a ten-minute walk each day for two weeks. the trial also found that both groups performed better on cognitive tests of visuospatial orientation and attention. the studies support the notion that increased physical exercise can be a useful strategy for weight management.the benefits of exercise are recognized by the number of people who maintain a healthy weight, a healthier waistline, and reduced risk for cardiovascular diseases. however, the relationship between exercise and weight is controversial. a 2012 review found that although exercise does have beneficial effects for weight loss, weight loss is likely to be more successful if started before age 20. the benefits of increasing waist-to-hip ratio are better understood in this context because that ratio has been shown to be a predictor for weight-loss.the relationship between exercise and cardiovascular disease is less clear. a 2012 meta-analysis found that exercise does not increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, but rather the risk of cardiovascular diseases is increased when compared with sedentary individuals. the meta-analysis was based on the hypertensive effect of exercise  a 2014 review found that moderate levels of musculoskeletal pain were an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. the authors concluded that the hypertensive effect of exercise appears to be more likely an adaptive response to a severe stressor. however, a 2012 review had found that lower levels of metabolic rate, sleep, eating, and hormone levels are all independently affected by exercise.the relation between obesity and cardiovascular disease is less clear. a 2012 meta-analysis found that obesity is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, but the relationship between weight and heart disease is more

85,"stuart klein, a professor at the yale school of management, has argued that, ""the challenges of entrepreneurship are baked in the DNA of human beings. it makes sense that a business which provides an entity that provides a service to another entity should have its business value determined by the service provided."" according to klein, the reason entrepreneurs ""don_t_give_a_shit_about_your_self"" is because they do not ""give a shit about yours"".klein states that because entrepreneurs ""don_t give a shit about their customers"" and because ""they dont care about your business or the company"", the business cannot be considered an investment.according to the business practice known as ""creative accounting"", an entrepreneur hopes to generate positive returns by maximizing net income from the business. this may involve minimizing expenses, maximizing the return, or maximizing the net income. the entrepreneur assumes risk, such as investing while operating a business. the risk is calculated according to the entrepreneurial risk model. profit from the business is assumed to be zero, which means there is no risk involved. the entrepreneur can, therefore, use the accounting principles to generate positive earnings.the term ""irrational exuberance"" was first used by the great ape raisinius in the 19th century to describe the excitement and rush that entrepreneurs felt upon discovering a new product or service. entrepreneurs are said to ""run wild with their emotions"" and are said to ""play with fire"".exuberance is a state of mind characterized by excessive consumption, lack of reflection on activities of daily living, and the absence of meaningful work or other concerns. exuberance is often associated with seeking out new experiences and situations, while avoiding mundane concerns. exuberance is a common trait of young people, but can also be found in old people, who engage in repetitive or inattentive behaviours in order to occupy their minds with excitement or entertainment.exuberance is a state of mind characterized by excessive consumption, lack of reflection on activities of daily living, and the absence of meaningful work or other concerns. exuberance is a common trait of young people, but can also be found in old people, who engage in repetitive or inattentive behaviours in order to occupy their minds with excitement or entertainment. the former description fits well with several observations about exuberance and anxiety, such as that excessive exuberance can lead to anxiety, irritability, and worry. this is contrasted with the former description of a person who is engaged in a productive activity and who does not indulge their emotions. the former description fits well with several observations about the mind and its functioning, such as that each day brings new opportunities for developing and testing new ideas and that work is sustained by the existence of work-associated work-life balance.exuberance is a state of mind characterized by excessive consumption, low self-awareness, and an inability to be considered an active participant in the temporal distribution of the wealth created by one who engages in ""creative"" activity. the term ""irrational exuberance"" was also used by l.e.b. brucell, one of the founders of the theory of irrational exuberance, to describe the state of mind of an individuals rational exuberance. the irrational exuberance theory posits that people who are not engaged in creative activities are not generating wealth and that the goal of generating wealth is not productive activity. this gives rise to the theory that the resources created by one who is not creative are not being used effectively. according to brucell, people who are not creative are not using their resources effectively because they are not using the resources effectively.the irrational exuberance theory was inspired by the experience of ronald coase, a chemist who had discovered chemical elements in water and who had been leading the effort to prove that the chemical forces in the elements were the product of random chemical reactions rather than the result of a process that had a specific beginning and ended at a predetermined point in time. coase was making the argument that because wealth is the product of productive activity, one should assume that the same productive activity is going to be used to generate wealth. according to brucell, this applies to the use of one sows seed to fertilize a field of grain and to the plant being left to recover its nutrients. if the sows is left to use its resources to fend off other predators, it is not productive; so it must be assumed that the same resources are not being used to fend off predators. according to brucell, this also applies to the use of one sheep to pull a cart. if the sheep is left to do this, it must also be assumed that it is not being used to pull the cart. this, combined with the fact that livestock are not used to pulling a cart, implies that the same resources are not being used to pull the cart. thus, brucell concluded that sheep are not simply passive consumers of the resources in their surroundings, but actively participate in the resources being used by their sheep.in",0,1

95," andrew mcchesney, a professor of political science at the yale school of management, has suggested that social inequality is a more important factor in the 2012 election than the economy, terrorism, the trade deal with canada, and the obamas nominating and confirming processes. he contends that the economic downturn and the terrorist attacks changed the politics of the country for the worse. he attributes this to the displacement of the middle class by the poor, the decline of conservatism, and the erosion of the middle class through technological advances. another prominent economist, robert coase, professor of political science at yale, has suggested that the great depression and the beginning of the cold war contributed to the election of george w. bush and ronald reagan, while the trade deals of the cold war contributed to the election of barack obama. in his book, political plants: the causes and consequences of the great depression  sharon salz, professor in political science at the yale school of management, has found evidence that two factors together can explain the election of scott pence. the cold war gave people a reason to be politically fearful, and terrorism gave people a reason to be politically terrified. pences victory over trump was ""due to pence being a stronger politician than obama"".the election of barack obama as president was widely perceived as a major success for the socialist socialist party. the party achieved a new, unprecedented level of influence in the united states government. in the 2009 election, the party had controlled the government through the work of the democratic party of the united states  obama won an estimated 332 of 568 electoral college votes in the u.s. congressional elections, more than any other democratic candidate since 1920. he took the most votes in the states that produced the most candidates. in the presidential election of 2012, he received more votes from independents and democratic-leaning super-delegates than any other candidate.obamas most notable accomplishment has been the passage of the patient protection and affordable care act, commonly referred to as ""replace-or-subtly"" health care reform legislation. the legislation, signed into law by obama on december 19, 2010, is the largest health care reform in the history of the united states. it addresses the problems of high costs, high deductibles, and the high costs and deductibles of health care. it is also the first time in the history of the united states that a single political party has succeeded in winning both the majority in both chambers of congress and the presidential election.obamacare, the largest health care reform in the history of the united states, was partially repealed by the president of the united states on december 19, 2013. obamas replacement plan, the american health care act, was partially re-passed in december of that year, and in february 2014 the supreme court upheld its constitutionality.obamacare is the product of an expensive and lengthy political battle between the parties. while the american health care act is considered by some to be one of the most politically expensive pieces of legislation in american history, other parts of the healthcare law have been found to provide substantial tax benefits and reductions in costs. the law also expanded medicaid eligibility for indiana residents and provided tax relief for individuals in the virginia and mississippi.obamacare has had a significant impact on the health care system in the united states. since its passage, the number of people without health insurance has decreased from 13 million to just over nine million in june 2014. in addition, the number of people without health insurance has increased from two million to three million in july 2014. the uninsured rate has declined from 35.4% in 2005 to 31.7% in 2014.obamacare also expanded medicaid eligibility for indiana residents and provided tax relief for individuals in the virginia and mississippi. it also expanded the medicaid eligibility age and lowered the cap on indiana residents who would be eligible to receive aid from public programs. the law also lowered the co-payback time for Medicaid and co-payback for private insurance plans from 6 to 3 years.obamacare also expanded medicaid eligibility for indianas 15 million uninsured poor. the law also said that if an indiana resident had a pre-existing condition, they could lose their health insurance coverage. the indiana congresswoman josh pravo said the law was ""a big, fat wad of money"" that had to be repaid with tax revenue.in july 2014, the kansas legislature passed a bill that required nearly all indianas businesses to offer health insurance to employees. the bill was signed into law on july 1, 2015. in september 2014, the kansas supreme court ruled the state could opt out of the health care law. in 2015, the federal courts upheld the decision.in 2014, the national institute for health and american research  the nhc finds that mandating health insurance coverage for indiana workers will have no positive effect",0,1

of teaching children throughout their lives to memorize material in order to better understand and create knowledge in the child. it is often seen as a work of the parents, teachers or other caregivers as a method of teaching, however, it is also intended to improve the childrens self-confidence and mental health. it is also believed to help parents and children to learn more in a less structured way.the term homeschooling covers the use of homeschooling by students  in many cases the training is done at home, rather than at a school, facility, or institution. the purpose of homeschooling is to help the child develop skills in house and learn at his or her own pace. students train by making crafts, learning crafts, and other activities. students complete projects individually, such as constructing items such as chairs, walls, beds, and a christmas ornament.theyll find many different types of information, teaching methods, and resources on the internet, in books, on youtube, or through the local school system. some homeschooled students may also obtain on the internet the materials they need to complete a project. the principal difference between homeschooled and public schools is that students are not allowed to ask questions, but must follow teacher led instruction. this is a form of learning that many parents choose to do in private schools, however, many public school students do not have this choice.in the private schools, students are allowed to choose which teacher leads they wish to follow. theyll be seated in a specific row, given a specific task, and then graded based on effort. it is also common for students to participate in group learning. the principal difference between homeschooled and public schools is that the student can be given material at home and choose which teacher to receive it from. in the classes that are taught at home, students are not allowed to make their own learning materials nor learn how to complete a project independently.studies have shown that children who have their own school and teachers are more likely to be referred to a counselor, in some cases, this is done in a ""cold book"", in which a teacher teaches only the material in the books materials. the counselor visits the child for a short period of time, after which the student is taken to a different classroom where a counselor teaches the same subject. some homeschooled students also enroll at a for-profit school or a charter school, which are also different from public schools in that students are not allowed to ask questions or learn from the material.a ""home-schooling"" or ""home-education"" is a childs choice type of home education. it is an educational method that involves providing materials at home and then using those materials at the beginning of the childs education. the child is not required to be a student in the traditional sense, but a student can be a student in the ""home schooling"" sense. a ""home-education"" may be customized to the child based on what skills the child already has, or the child could learn from scratch. a ""home-schooling"" is a method where the child learns through play.a homeschooled student may receive formal or informal ""support"" from parents, teachers, or other students of the school, community, or other group to help them achieve an education. this can include instruction in the home about the schools ""core curriculum"", such as the core curriculum, lesson designs, and lessons, such as composition, grammar, and spelling, taught by non-educational staff. a homeschooled student may also receive referrals to tutoring. the student will learn in a tutoring environment, with non-educational teachers and other students providing instruction and support.home schooling is a form of attendance that is generally more structured and less spontaneous than homeschooling. it is a learning experience for students, where parents, teachers, or other students of the school provide education at home. it is also a learning environment where parents, teachers, and other students learn through play.home schooling is a learning environment where parents, teachers, and other students provide instruction and support.home schooling may also be called home education, home-based education, home-based learning,",0,1
97,"the united states has been known to have the most prolific of all nations in the world in terms of climate change; it is the largest carbon emitter per capita, and the worlds two largest emitters of greenhouse gases.as a nation, the united states has been the leader in environmental activism since the beginning of the 20th century. the united states has been at the forefront of several environmental movements, and the environmental movement has had a particularly strong presence at the national level in the united states. the environmental movement grew out of a reaction to the cold war. the environmental movement is often described as a ""conservationist"" - the conservation movement is devoted to the preservation of natural resources, such as the environment. the term ""green"" is often used interchangeably with the term ""environmentalist"" or ""socialist"" to describe those who work to minimize or mitigate environmental damage, such as those working to reduce global warming.environmentalism emerged from the anti-establishment movement in the 1960s and 1970s whose leaders were socialists and environmentalists. the movement focused on environmentalism as an alternative to environmentalism, sometimes identified as a ""renewable energy"" or ""energy conservation"" movement. the movement urged alternative forms of social organization to address environmental problems, such as energy poverty, energy shortage, and energy policy. the movement stressed the need for people to be able to solve environmental problems without resorting to the fossil fuel industry. it was strongly associated with the anti-establishment conservation movement. the environmental movement was primarily associated with a radical environmentalist perspective, including a concern for the earths ecological sustainability. the environmental movement attracted a strong following in the 1960s and 1970s, with many student environmentalists involved in environmental issues. the movement attracted a large following among younger people, particularly during the cold war. the concept of ""renewable energy"" was first used by the alliance for a just transition, a coalition of student environmentalists, industrialists, and libertarian economists for environmentalism. the coalition was formed with other student left-wing political organizations. the term ""renewable energy"" is a combination of renewable energy  the new york times wrote in 1974, ""renewable energy has become a new political force; the environmental movement, once a dead-end for the leftist activists, has become a force of life.""renewable energy is an alternative energy source, and is usually associated with wind, geothermal, hydrothermal, and solar energy. however, it has also been associated with hydrogen, ethanol, and biofuel as well as electricity and even hydrogen-rich liquid fuels. wind power and geothermal energy are often used to power electric vehicles, some of which have been used to send people across the atlantic ocean to a new life. some wind turbines have been installed at military bases to provide a continuous source of energy.renewable energy is typically specified as kilowatt hours  the energy required to produce one watt of electricity is given as eewb, or kWh, the value of kWh for electricity production is given as eew, or kWh.a wind turbine, like all wind power plants, uses energy that has the potential to be stored as carbon dioxide, but is not. the energy stored as carbon dioxide is called greenhouse gas  therefore, any energy production from a wind farm must be balanced against the potential to recapture carbon dioxide. as of 2009, the major energy storage technologies that exist are battery storage and the use of tectonic plates to strain the crust to release trapped carbon dioxide.carbon dioxide is a gas produced by human activity that can be stored as carbon, either in the form of carbon inorganic carbon or a mixture of carbon in the form of carbon. when stored as carbon dioxide, it is a solid at minus 273.5, the carbon is said to be in the form of carbon monoxide. in the presence of a catalyst, a mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen is formed, which reacts with the reactive groups in the gas. this reaction creates a gas called carbon monoxide, which is a solid at minus 273.5. it is not clear how carbon monoxide is formed. it is formed by the decomposition of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  the amount of carbon dioxide is unknown, but it is thought to be as a byproduct of the decomposition of carbonic acid.the production of carbon monoxide, as opposed to gas produced by burning fossil fuels, is the method of production that is most commonly used to dispose of carbon dioxide. it is also the most carbon-intensive. the production of carbon monoxide is the most energy-intensive part of the manufacture of carbon credits, and intertidal zones are another important source of energy. the production of carbon monoxide requires a catalyst that can store carbon dioxide as carbon dioxide, a material that is not produced by burning fossil fuels. this requires a catalyst that can store carbon dioxide in the form of carbon monoxide. the carbon dioxide that is required to make one ton of carbon dioxide is not produced by any particular process. rather",0,1

106," the ancient greek philosopher celsus wrote in his history of the world against the tetrarchy which is considered by many to be the core of the taoist and hsrian ideas on how to win the wars of the world. the taoist celestes advocated a strategy of conquering the weak points and creating a powerful empire through an active re-awakening of the noble savage. the hsuan school of taoism, founded by hsin, aimed to build a powerful empire through a combination of military conquest and economic expansion through trade.the chinese taoism and hsin school of taoism were both opposed to the taoist and hsin school taoism is a school of thought that views the tao as the only truly universal universal spiritual teaching and the only way to attain immortality. it is different from hsin school of taoism in that hsin considered the tao as a path that can be followed without necessarily experiencing death, and likewise, it is not the path that can be followed without experiencing death. the two schools are considered to have been closely connected since the beginning of taoism.the origin of taoism is generally considered to have started in 221 bc when the taoist master buddha satyamena, along with buddhhatyamena and buddha-instinct, founded the buddhist order of six treasures in japan. the buddhist order of six treasures was founded by buddhist monks whose primary goal was to free themselves from the restraint of worldly desires and to awaken to the pure teachings of buddha. they did this through intensive study in buddhist monasteries and temples, and through the practice of buddhist medicine.taoism was a major school of thought in chinese history. huang kong described taoism as ""the one philosophy, the one path, of the tao."" taoism developed from buddhistism, which was the dominant world school of thought at that time, and was the school of thought that huang kong, chinese nationalist leader tao bajie and other chinese leaders were brought into being taoist monasteries and temples.taoism developed out of buddhist teachings, especially the four chan masters  the buddhist order of the six treasures was a school of thought that saw buddhism as a way of seeing the world, and taoism as a way to achieve this in practice. the buddhist order of the six treasures developed out of buddhist temples, out of the temples themselves, and through buddhist monks who disseminated buddhist teachings and rituals to taoist magistrates and lay persons.taoism has had a long and complex history. taoism has existed as a religion, an art, a philosophy, a culture and a political movement, and has been both the subject of and the object of academic study. in the western world, taoism is the most well-known and widely practised religion, with temples in nearly every western country, schools, scriptures, temples, lay organizations and temples, all of which are temples of the western world. taoism is the second-most studied religion in the world, after christianity.the taoist canon includes mantras, sutras, and a number of works that contain the tao as the central concept. many of the texts of the tao are expressed through these works and the taoist canon is one of the major sources of taoist theology.the taoist canon includes texts from the buddhist traditions of india, china, tibet, japan, and laos. texts from the hindu and sikh traditions are also found in tibet and india. texts from the chinese buddhist tradition are also found in laos. tibetan buddhism has also been influenced by buddhist traditions.tibetan buddhism also has its own buddhist traditions. these are also known as buddhist buddhist practices, buddhist monastics and buddhist spirituals.tibetan buddhism is also influenced by jain and taoist traditions. some of the buddhist practices are associated with the practice of buddhist meditation. tibetan buddhism also has buddhist practices, such as chanting buddhist mantras and buddhist buddhist ceremonies. some of the buddhist mantras are associated with the practice of buddhist meditation. buddhist spirituals also practice buddhist meditation.tibetan buddhism also contains buddhist practices such as buddhist medicine, buddhist ceremonies, buddhist rituals, buddhist monastics, buddhist vows, buddhist practices, buddhist practices, buddhist iconography, budd",0,1

which deals with the interaction between sound and air, is the branch of physics that studies sound. it is the branch of science that examines the physical mechanisms of sound, and the study of sound in detail.physics professor noah feldman studies the behavior of high-energy particles, which are the particles that make up the high energy of the universe. particle physics is the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of particles at the very high energies that they provide, being the fundamental subatomic particles of physics.ergravitational-collars are the study of colliding objects that provide gravitational forces. gravitational-collars are also the study of colliding black holes, which are the objects of interest in the astrophysics.physics professor robert hoagland has

classical physics, quantum physics and string theory.his experiments have revealed that the speed of light is a measure of the speed of light, and that the speed of light is a measure of the speed of light. he has also discovered that the expansion of the universe can be used to measure the speed of light, and that the expansion of the universe can be used to measure the speed of light.the history of physics is the history of discoveries and understanding. in the sense that the process of discovering and using new ideas was started, not ended, the history of physics is a period of time that starts and ends with new discoveries. the period is divided into two parts: part i deals with the development of new ideas, and the part ii deals with the understanding and experiments of the

131,"the sun is the warm, moist surface of the sun that provides a positive temperature gradient on which the climate is based. like the earth, the sun is a sphere, with a center point at the equator and a periphery at the poles. unlike the earth, the sun is a globe, with a center point at the north pole and a periphery at the south pole. the sun is the only known partially elliptical body, and the only terrestrial body that rotates around its axis.the poles are the only part of the earth that are warmer than the north pole. because the north and south poles are much further away from the sun  this is the reason why the north pole has had a much warmer climate than the south pole. the surface of the sun is much more reflective than the surface of the earth. the albedo, or brightness level, of the sun is higher at the north pole than at the south pole because the albedo is much higher at the north pole than at the south pole.the albedo of the sun is determined by the ratio of the luminosity of the sun to the area of the moonlight that falls on the earth. the higher the albedo, or the greater the amount of light reflects back from the sun, the hotter the suns surface appears. at a value of 700\\xa0th century. with the advent of dynamical systems, such as dynamical systems of the sun, the dynamical system of the sun can be perturbed with the movement of the earth. the sun and the earth are now moving apart, due to the movements of the moon. the suns movement is causing the earth to move slightly, which is causing the oceans to reflect some of the energy back into space. in the past, this energy was used to create large quantities of iron, but the emission of iron from the oceans now causes the oceans to lose their heat. once the energy is released, it is possible to see the effect of this energy on the oceans surface. at the same time, the heat of the deep ocean is being made available by the movement of the warm surface of the sun, so the heat of the sun itself is being made available. this heat is being made available to the oceans, so that when the warm surface is moved to the left, the heat is made available for the conversion of chemical energy into heat. this heat is now being made available for the conversion of energy into heat and light, and the heat of the sun itself is being made available for the conversion of chemical energy into light and electricity. this heat is now being made available for the conversion of chemical energy into electricity and light.electricity is the basic energy that powers computers, appliances, robots, appliances, robots, and many other systems. it is also the source of light that allows light to be sent from one place to another, or to be emitted by a source light, into another place, or into the world at large. it is also the source of sound, and the stimulus for many other sounds. electric power was invented by the german burgener ralph cernovsky  as of 2010, electric vehicles have reached speeds of 60 kilometers per hour  the amount of energy used to create and sustain the electric power in a vehicle varies with the speed, but is typically in the range of 20 to 50 kwh batteries, which are about twice the energy used by a typical power grid to store electricity. in 2010, the energy density of energy in a renewable resource like energy was estimated at 149 gJ joules per kilowatt-hour.  battery technology is expected to increase the density of energy sources in a renewable resource like energy to be released, but to store and convert electrical energy into mechanical energy. the mechanical energy for such conversion is stored in the form of a battery, which is then used to conduct electrical current in the form of electricity. the energy stored in the form of battery is then used to power a mechanical device like a motor, generator, or other mechanical device. the energy stored in the form of battery is then converted back into mechanical energy, which in turn is used to provide electric current to a mechanical device like a motor.the energy of the earth, the mass of the earths crust, is the fundamental resource of the universe. because its vast size and composition are similar to that of the solar system, earths gravity pulls the planet into a circular orbit around the sun, the suns gravity acts on the earth, bringing it into a semi-transparent orbit around the sun, and then rotating the earth so that it appears to be rotating on a helical spiral. the rotation of the earth causes the suns gravity to act on the earth, bringing it into a semi-transparent orbit around the sun. this causes the earth to appear to rotate. this process of solar self-emergence repeats in a region of space periodically. the same process can be used to measure the distance to distant stars.the earth is also the center of the earth system, composed",0,1

and fort wayne met on october 12, 1967, at a breakfast meeting of the church of the holy see in rome. the two priests shared a common commitment to the liberation war and shared the same political philosophy: ""we believe that the fight for human freedom starts with the liberation of the oppressed."" in addition to the traditional unionist, catholic and liberty unionist symbols, they were encouraged to form a union with the anglican churches.in may 1970, the first annual congress of the catholic church in south carolina was held in philadelphia. the congress was a gathering of representatives from both the catholic and liberty union congregations and was attended by about 2,000 representatives of the three major political parties. this was the first such gathering in south carolina, and it is also where the first black republican elected to the u.s. house of representatives was elected.in 1972, the south carolina legislature enacted a law that excluded from voter registration rolls the religious and political affiliations of those who did not live in the state or vote in the state. the law was challenged in a suit by the people, who alleged that it violated the states constitution and unfairly discriminated against them. the courts dismissed the suit three times in the 1980s and 1990s, and in the last two cases the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit overturned the discriminatory voter registration law suit.federal court rulings in the early 1980s affirmed the south carolina voter registration law. on february 22, 1986, the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit overturned the discriminatory voter registration law suit.in the early 1990s, a lawsuit challenging south carolinas voter registration law was filed by the american civil liberties union, american library association, and south carolina democrats. the lawsuit alleged that the voter registration law violated the states constitution and the fair elections act. the courts dismissed the suit three times in the 1990s, and again in the 2000s, and in both cases the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit overturned the discriminatory voter registration law suit.in the 2010s, the south carolina legislature passed a voter registration law that was challenged in a suit by the south carolina chapter of the cfba. the legislature subsequently repealed the law without effective implementation. in the 2011 u.s. midterm elections, the national republican senatorial committee paid a visit to the state to monitor the progress of the case.south carolina is home to a number of institutions that are memorialized in the state. the confederate battle flag, the confederate battle memorial, the confederate battle field, and the confederate battle iv all stand in stark contrast to the many sunday flag displays throughout the state. in the united states, syringes are the state symbols and are prominently featured in state flags and state sealings, while confederate battle flags are venerated in tomales. confederate battle flags are stored at the confederate battle museum in hancock county. the confederate battle fields and battle iv structures are

134,"aka ""the convention of the sexes"" is a set of conventions, rules, and codes that guide the conduct of a persons interaction with others. the goal of the convention of the sexes is to make human society conform to the biological differences between men and women and to encourage and support the equal treatment and opportunities of men and women in society. the term was coined in 1901 by a group of scholars and activists concerning the violation of gender stereotypes by the sexual oppression of women by men.according to karl kenrick and carroll quigley, a pair of sociologists, ""the conventions of the sexes"" are ""structuralized through gender roles"" and can be said to form a social norm"". the sets of conventions are shaped by the dynamics of gender relations and the construction of power relations. these conventions are transmitted from generation to generation.according to scholars, there are a number of competing explanations for these gender roles. one explanation is that these roles are not mutually exclusive and that the variations in roles between men and women reflect a generalization of gender roles across cultures. another explanation is that gender roles are not universally shared and that gender-variant people have been historically discriminated against on the basis of gender roles. a final explanation is that the differences between men and women are due to individual differences in cognitive, affective, and affective styles  the convention of the sexes is used by men and women to justify their differences and to control their emotions.adolescents are taught in schools to use gender-variant language to talk about themselves and to express their gender identity. adolescents also learn about their own gender identity through the media, such as the gender role that they were assigned at birth. these teachings also help them to feel comfortable in their own skin. however, the age difference between a male and female has not been found to influence the way adolescents self-present their gender identity; rather, it has been found that the age difference between men and women is only a small cause of their gender difference. in contrast, older children are more likely to be influenced by a theory on gender stereotypes, which explains the observed gender difference in test scores and the belief that older children are more confident talking about themselves and less likely to believe that other children are talking about them as well.between the 1980s and the 1990s, as intersex persons became more widely accepted, they came to be viewed as having a gender identity in contrast to the traditional gender roles that historically defined their gender. these theories were often based on a variety of assumptions, such as the notion that gender roles are universal, that gender roles can be culturally fluid, and that sexual orientation is fluid. these theories also had problems with evidence, such as the widely cited 2010 study that concluded intersex people are genetically predisposed to having gender dysphoria  and the 2009 study that found only 12% of intersex people are likely to be homosexual.the international standard defines the term ""intersex"" to include individuals born with gonadal or genital sex characteristics that do not fit typical binary gender categories, such as the intersex male or female, intersex female, and intersex male. apart from these, there are also people whose sex was not designated as ""male"" or ""female"" in their birth certificate but whose sex was ""assumed"" to be male or female. these are people who are neither males nor females.intersex individuals are those whose sex is the opposite of the typical binary gender categories, such as intersex woman or intersex man. they are the ""undiagnosable"" because they are ""far beyond the developmental stages typically associated with the typical gender categories"":they are ""developing brains that are undeveloped but shaped by sex.""in addition to intersex individuals, gender dysphoria in some cases is first diagnosed in childhood, while other cases are diagnosed as adults. there are cases of intersex people who are transgender or cross-dresser, whose sex was not designated in their birth certificate but whose gender was inferred from their gender identity or appearance on the basis of their sex appearance in their youth. the terms transgender and cross-dresser are often used interchangeably, although transgender is sometimes used more broadly as an umbrella term, including gender variant or cross-dresser.the international standards set out clear requirements for the expression of gender identity. the ICS defines genderqueer as ""a person whose genderqueer identity corresponds to the sex that they were assigned at birth"". it also specifies that a transgender person is someone whose gender does not match their appearance, genderqueer is more specific, meaning a person whose gender does not correspond to their appearance, while cross-dresser is someone whose gender does correspond to their gender identity. trans is used more often in the contemporary context, while cross-dresser is used less often.the term transgender is sometimes used as a pejorative, although not always.the term transgender is sometimes used derogatorily, as being synonymous with transsexualism  transgender is, however, not completely interchangeable with transgender. some transgender people",0,1

that the novel was too complex and enthralling for that. instead, he found that having a film shoot-out format would serve the film better as it had more of a story than a random witness. he also found the story elements boring.film historians have noted that the film may have inspired the british school of playwright john maddison. each of the film characters had the character invent a play,

136," is part of the cranium. the cranium is the outer layer of the skull, the largest and most complex of the three mammalian skulls. it contains many sutures, embedded nerves, sinuses, and foramen. it is also where the air and water of the lungs are vented. cranium is divided into three parts, a lower jaw, an upper jaw and a gill pouch.the fossil skull of a 17- to 18-million-year-old homin was discovered in the jakarta desert in september 2006 by thomas henry trompfert. its skull measures 15.2 by 10.1 by 3.6 metres  the knuckle-less, or ""phulpen knuckle"", is a hominid of the middle Pleistocene species and thus closely related to modern humans.the hominid cranium is a classic example of a ""supercranial"" skull. the skull, which measures 15.3 by 11.1 by 3.5 metres  a 2016 study of the skull of a hominid from china identified a partial occiputectomy, possibly a type of retrocranial sutura. the retrocranial sutura is a partial occiputectomy of the frontal part of the skull.the earliest known use of cranium fossils was in the fossil record preserved in the holocene cranium of the extinct palaeoloxodon africanus. the earliest known use of cranium is in the holocene fossil record from the late eocene fossil holocene of lungfish  there are three species of cranium: the lithostracophoid cranium  the most recent cranial species are the africanized, or amauropod crana.the african cranium is often mistaken for the amauropod, which has been suggested to have been an ancestor to at least two hominids. however, the genus atlacracophus is more widely accepted to be an independent species. craniums have been proposed to have been evolved from amauropods, but evidence for this has been conflicting, and much work remains. it has also been proposed that the cranium was evolved from a monophyletic group of about 50 million years ago.the first hominid known to be extinct was palaeoloxodon namadicus, which was cambrian- and caspian-adapted with the largest skull of all modern mammals. this made it possibly the most ""modern"" of all hominids. it also gave it four features unique to modern humans: it had short snouts, large upper jaws, well-developed lower limbs, and large brains.the last common ancestor of hominids and other hominoids that are still extant are the gracilian, meaning ""mammal-like"", and bantu-like. the gracilian also possessed the largest cranium of all hominids, but its demise was short-lived, as it expired during the cenozoic era about 217 million years ago. the last common ancestor of hominids and other hominoids to be found in the fossil record is the amauropod crania. the last common ancestor of both groups was the hominid crania. the amauropod is slightly smaller than the hominid and has a shorter skull, a less convex upper jaw, and less cranial capacity. the cranial capacity of the hominid is similar to that of the hominocranial groups.the hominoid crania are the only two hominids that have partial skull, but their crania are also the only two that lack a well-developed skull. the earliest known hominids that lacked a complete skull did not emerge until after the cenozoic and not until the palaeozoic. the earliest known hominid that did have a complete skull is homo habilis, which lived 245 to 161 million years ago. the crania of homo habilis are shared by both the australian and brazilian groups. the australian group shared the largest cranial capacity of all hominids, with the dna-genetic analysis suggesting that this was the result of a haplogroup i substitution. the brazilian group shared the largest cranial capacity of all hominids, with the dna-genetic analysis suggesting that this was the result of a haplogroup i substitution. the australian and brazilian groups shared the last cranial capacity of all hominids. the franco-pilam manual is the collection of stories that developed around the franco-american model of human creation. the stories were collected by different groups of people within the year between 1821 and 1829 and the publication of the first edition in 1826. the book was an important document in the understanding of human origins, the development of social behavior,",0,1

139,".the subject of the animal kingdom is a wide-ranging area of study that traces its back to ancient greece and ancient india, although its beginnings predate the world as we know it. the term ""aquatic kingdom"" is often used to refer to a particular region or country, while ""aquatic society"" or ""aquatic law"" is sometimes used to refer to a society or a political system. in the united states, the mexican state of tlaxcala, and in some other countries including the united kingdom, the uk, australia, new zealand, and canada, the term ""aquatic kingdom"" is used to refer to various geographic areas, or regions, encompassing all of the oceans and all of the life that is not terrestrial.the word ""aquatic"" is derived from the ancient greek 0th century, conservation efforts in many parts of the world were focused on the preservation of pristine ecosystems, and efforts were made to limit human-induced destruction of natural ecosystems. in the united states, the soviet union and other countries, the use of fish farming became a major way to restore ecosystems. since the industrial revolution, aquaculture has become a major way to feed the worlds growing population. aquaculture is practiced and regulated according to strict laws and regulations with the goal of sustainability. the usage of the term ""aquatic"" comes from the latin aqua, meaning water, and the ancient greek aleph, a fish. the term ""aquatic"" is used in the context of the fishes, the freshwater fish, or the aquatic plant, and the medieval vernacular term ""aquae"", a fish.the word ""aquatic"" was used in the 16th century by william herschel to refer to some of these fish, specifically the clark  many medieval writers included a number of species in this group, including the aqua, the bahrain, the chukchi, the dhol, the gourdet, the grosgan, the hart, the ibises, the javan, the kiel, the moravia, the netherlands, and the swedish town of burg. there are three species of bony fish, the saltwater piersids or saltwater crocodiles, the freshwater snails and the mega-saltwater crocodiles.the earths oceans are over 6,000,000  and are believed to be as dry as the earths continents. the oceans water is not frozen on the north pole, but is in fact over 100,000 km2. they hold the water as the most important resource of the planet, and currently are the worlds largest water producer. the oceans surface is not covered by land plants, so there is no carbon in the atmosphere, but is indirectly affected by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. the oceans annual ocean surface water absorption does not exceed 3,000,000,000 litres per year. this is equal to 3,154,000,000   by comparison, the earths oceans heat capacity, which would be needed to melt snow and heat the oceans annual oceans surface water absorption, is equivalent to the annual heat absorption of all human-made carbon, excluding deforestation and land use changes. the oceans annual heat uptake is greater than that of all land, and is greater than that of the entire earth. oceanographers use a variety of models to estimate the heat uptake of oceans, but the best known is a ratio of 0.1 between the oceans annual heat uptake and the global ocean heat content. the ocean absorbs some of the heat from the land surface and radiates it as heat from the deep oceans. this process, known as heat sinking, is the same for both land and ocean.atmospheric oceans are dominated by water vapor, and are mostly composed of water vapor suspended in a vapor phase. infrared radiation, mostly from sulfuric acid, and some from carbon dioxide, cause water vapor to condense on the ocean surface and cause water to freeze. this condensation results in a water-reversing process called osmotic circulation, wherein the water moves past, and absorbs, organic molecules, thus reducing the concentrations of these molecules in the water and the Osmotic circulation. oceanographers use a variety of models to estimate the heat uptake of oceans, but the one that is most widely accepted is an exchange of water vapor for carbon dioxide. foam is the best known oceanographer to use this method, although others have used or plan to use another method.eelmeproterozoic sea  is also known as the megafauna, which is the only living creature to have paleozoic teeth. it is the only living creature to have teeth in the jaw position. its jaw has nine ""lobes"" on top of each tooth and has worked its way up to a total of 21 grooves. it is similar in form to the extinct palaeoloxodon amoensis, but",0,1

146,"spain was the biggest oil producer in the world, but oil production was restricted by prohibition and the military. the population of spain was dependent on foreign trade, and the spanish state had to import large amounts of foreign goods. in 1810, the spanish government declared that all oil wells must be shut down. until 1819, spain had been exporting oil from its own reserves to other countries. the economic crisis of 18209, however, did not allow for the importation of more oil into spain. the spanish government began to develop an external policy towards oil producing countries in the 18th century that included oil, coinage, and land grants. as a result of the french and british economic crises in the 19th century, spain became an exporter of oil and became a net importer of oil in the 19th century. by 1850, spain had developed into a multi-national state and economy and was the worlds fifth largest oil producer, after the british empire, the united states, and france.although spain was a net importer of oil during the first half of the 19th century, it was a heavy oil importer in the second half of the 19th century. during the first half of the 19th century, spain was the seventh largest oil producer in the world after the united states, japan, and canada. spain had the largest oil reserves of all the oil producers in the world, and they were the largest oil reserves in the world by volume. in 1885, it had 13010, it was the 5th largest oil producer in the world. spain had a bad economy in the first half of the century, partly because of the spanish civil war and the subsequent decline of the economy. the spanish civil war of 1936 to 1939 was the worst industrial war the country ever suffered.in the 1940s, the economy slowly recovered from the spanish civil war, but the war cut off oil revenues for years. spain was again placed in a period of economic decline in the 1950s and 1960s.spain had an oil-exporting government during the spanish civil war that had to balance the budget, pay interest on loans, and make payments on exports.spains oil revenues were not balanced until the 1970s. during the 1980s, spain had a balanced budget, but after the 1990s recession, spain had a negative balance, unable to service its debts. the government was forced to raise taxes or cut spending.spain had a gross domestic product of $34007, having risen to $36007. the countrys economic growth rate slowed slightly to 3.5% in the first quarter of 2013, and was the slowest since the year 2010. in the second quarter of 2013, economic growth picked up again, to 5.3%, while unemployment fell from 11.9% in the first quarter of 2012 to 10.5% in the second quarter of 2013. the countrys trade balance with the world was a negative $2054.4 million in the first quarter of 2013.spain remains one of the most indebted countries in the world, as evidenced by the size of its sovereign debt. despite this, spain has the worlds third-largest economy and the fifth-largest military in the world, and is one of the worlds top ten largest manufacturing nations.spain is a unitary state and is divided into 14 parishes0th century, a combination of the cities of leyden, hubbard and seahaven in the united states. the spanish flu pandemic is commemorated on the 50th anniversary of the pandemic, which spain opened the year following on 13 february, which has been observed as a mark of solidarity with the spanish community in the event of pandemic and spanish flu pandemics in one anothers countries, and the united states and canada have been affected by the pandemic and are witnessing a multi-phased effort to combat the pandemic. the spanish government announced in june 2013 that the country would set up a $1019 that the spanish government would spend up to $11.4014, the population was estimated to be between 5 and 10 million. as of july, there were about 200,000 deaths. the death toll was expected to reach 1 million within a week.according to a 2013 study by the world bank, the average spanish in 2017 was 10.0 years. about 16.7% of the population had at least one parent who was born in the spanish community. the median age in 2017 was 39.7 and the total population was 44.9.spanish is the second-most widely understood language in the world, as people speak it todays. spanish was used as a language of the empire for over a millennium and was spoken as a language by the majority of the population. spanish was not written in stone, but rather ""in letters,  in each case of",0,1
147,"the international association for the study of philosophy, an interdisciplinary scholarly organization, lists 12 major philosophical schools, often based on particular significance of the texts considered most important. the study of philosophy is called the discipline of philosophy, and the study of philosophy or philosophy is called epistemology. other inter-disciplinary studies include:the study of philosophy often takes the form of an intellectual exercise or inquiry, such as philosophical inquiry into the philosophy of art or philosophical discussion about philosophical topics. some of these may be systematic, using methods such as surveys or surveys, discussion of empirical evidence, empirical analysis of theories and the development of theories, discussion of the social context in which philosophical systems are embedded or maintained, and the development of theories. the study of philosophy may also take place in non-scientific settings, including informal settings, such as the study of poetic structures or the study of language as a way of thinking about language.the primary students of philosophy often come from a variety of backgrounds, often having previous backgrounds in fields of study. there are students who study the philosophy of science, who have studied logic, and who have studied metaphysics. students who study religion, such as comparative religion and the study of religion and science, may come from a variety of backgrounds, including history, popular culture, and philosophy. students who study history or the study of religion may come from a variety of backgrounds, including popular culture and/or the history of religions. students who study philosophy may come from a variety of backgrounds, including:the study of philosophy can take many different forms, including formal classes, seminars, readings, and other educational settings.the formal study of philosophy began around 1600, when men like pascal kastelius, johann blumenbach, and auguste comte studied philosophy at university. later, in the 19th century, formal study of philosophy grew out of the discipline of political philosophy, which focused on issues such as sovereignty, law, morality, the divinity of the state, and the origin of legal theory. in the late 19th century, this discipline was further developed by the study of political philosophy, which sought to apply political philosophy to the philosophy of religion. the study of political philosophy also included the study of the philosophy of economics, and the study of the philosophy of the state  formal study of philosophy continued after the 1890s, including the formal study of capitalism, political philosophy, political sociology, and issues of political power and the rule of law at the end of the 19th century.a further development in philosophy of law came in the early 1900s, with the development of the positivist school, which defended the law as a rational construct with no objective validity, and the rise of modern liberal theory. in the 20th century, the positivists built on the ideas of the positivists with the development of individualist and anti-positivist perspectives. these perspectives led to the rise of anti-scientific positivism, which further developed into anti-scientific individualism and anti-scientific positivism. in the 20th century, anti-scientific positivism led to the development of the scientific positivist school, which defended the scientific method as a rational construct with no objective validity. the scientific positivist school also included the idea that knowledge is only the manifestation of knowledge of the world through the senses, or that the world is somehow unknowable through the senses. the positivist school further developed into the idea that knowledge is the material manifestation of knowledge through the senses. the positivist school continues to be a part of the current philosophical community.another development in the philosophy of science came in the 1950s, when the new science of quantum mechanics was developed. this ground-breaking work opened the way to a new understanding of nature. in the 1960s, the new approach to quantum mechanics was further developed by eugene fry and others, who established a model of the nervous system at the center of quantum physics. this model described the interaction of forces in quantum mechanics. the 1970s saw the scientific creation of new dimensions, with the formation of the quantum gravity group, and the studies of quantum mechanics and gravitation were created from this perspective.the study of physics, known as physics, has been described as having two schools:the first wave may be that of the physical moment, arising from the quantum mechanical moment or physical moment  the second wave may be that of the physical law, arising from the classical physics of nature and the theory of relativity.referring to the classical physics of nature and its theory of relativity, the following is a description of the quantum field called the quantum mechanics which is the basis for the study of the behavior of particles, and also the physical laws that govern the movement of particles and forces in the universe. the following is a description of the quantum field called the quantum field, and its implications for the theory of relativity.the invention of quantum mechanics allowed a new analysis to be introduced into the nature of motion in nature, and this new analysis caused the modern concept of time to be discovered. in 1806",0,1

149,"an ancient view, based on the knowledge of the dead, of the future state of the world, and of the social order and laws of nature, held that all human beings were created equal, that they are endowed with inherent rights, that society pre-supposes that some people will be able to acquire certain rights, and that the existence of particular human beings is a consequence of society pre-supposing that the existence of society pre-pre-supposing that some people will be able to acquire certain rights. the view can be traced back to at least the 4th century bc, possibly earlier. the construction of the plato republic was followed by a wave of epics, variously attributed to different authors, which sometimes overlapped or were simultaneously produced by and for the platoists. what is sometimes called the plato approach to ethics is often identified with the plato of the first century, and the ethics that were followed there. the ethic of the plato republic is highly regarded in the western world and is often called the plato ethics. in the majority of countries, it has become part of the public sphere, and is represented in public discourse. the platoians approach to ethics is often characterized by the phrase ""platoskaya polje"", which translates as ""always, always good""  the doctrine of the trinity was a concept that was central to the philosophy of the renaissance, closely linked to the ideas of the savants, and also to the ethics of monasticism. in the 17th century, the french philosopher saint-simon led a movement of secularization, rejecting the notion of divine right as espoused by the catholic church, the pope, and the learned laity. this was a reaction to the rhetoric of catholicism, which had been characterized by the importance of the role of reason and science, and the absence of religious feeling or worship. in the 19th century, a number of new forms of religious thought emerged, including new religious movements, such as the new religious reaction, the enlightenment, and the universal savior. the first person to use the phrase ""plato"" in a purely academic context was luca scannavino, professor of political science at the university of illinois, who wrote in 1787: ""the idea of a university founded on the foundation of free and unfree ideas, founded on the idea of free inquiry, founded on the idea of free thought, and founded on the idea of the equality of all human beings, is a very ancient institution.""plato also wrote numerous pamphlets which, although largely unpublished, influenced the development of the democratic political philosophy of the period. the most influential of these were the dialogues b uthere and tertullian, which were first published in italy and then translated into other european languages. plato also wrote the de rerum, the dialogues critica, and the ten kin of tertullian. other works by plato include the de rerum on the civil war, the de rerum critica on political economy, and the dialogues kin of ferus and kin.the philosopher plato is often considered to have had a major impact on the field of political science, through his works on the ethics of warfare and his method of metaphysics. plato also wrote the platonic dialogues, which were influential for centuries on the development of western political thought, and on the development of the philosophical discipline of politics. plato also wrote a series of dialogues on the view of the philosopher plato, the first of which was given as oral history. plato also wrote on religion and philosophy, in the dialogues kin of ferus and kin, as well as the ten kin of tertullian.plato is considered to have been the founding father of the liberal tradition in the western world, where economic democracy and the rule of law take primary place. platos thought is known as romanticism. his ""advice to men"" is the central theme in the romantic universe, a work that was widely read and heard throughout europe. plato is often credited with being the author of the founding text of the romantic movement.plato was also a major influence in the development of political thought in the eastern world, where, following the rise of islam, the dhimmah, and the decline of the roman empire, the qin dynasty was founded. in the islamic world, his influence was even greater, as the qin dynasty continued to expand throughout the following centuries to claim hegemony over the entire arabian peninsula.the classical greek philosopher aristotle is often credited with having laid the foundations of western political thought. many historians credit plato with providing the first philosophical justification for the existence of political entities such as governments, the rule of law, the legitimacy of sovereignty, and the legitimacy of government itself. he provided a systematic exposition of a set of propositions, called the law, and a complete analysis of the nature of legal systems and practices. plato then moved on to analyse",0,1

second-largest pharmacy benefit management company in the us. the number of employees in the united states is lower because the nature of prescription drug utilization varies by patient age, body type, health status, health conditions, health insurance status, health history, health policy, medications being used, health conditions, physician services being used, medications having been used, allergies, medications, and other factors.in 2013, the company had revenues of us$12.5 billion, with a ratio of us$120 million in revenue to us$20 million in debt.pharmacy utilization is the

brands and lines was released in december 2017 alongside a detailed explanation of how the report was to be interpreted. the report found generic medications accounted for 2.5% of cost of a patients prescription in the united kingdom in 2018, though new drugs often cost much more. the study estimated new generics accounted for us$29 billion of total prescription revenue in the united kingdom in 2018.the study also found that patient satisfaction was a significant determinant of prescribing decisions. it found that more than twice as many people were prescribed a particular medication in the year before they became dissatisfied with the way the medicine was working  in the united states, about 10% of prescriptions were for non-generic drugs. new markets were found to be difficult to open, with the average pharmacy in the united states refusing to sell to new patients for several years.a number of factors contributed to increased demand for prescription drugs. in the united states, the main sources of new prescriptions are over-the-counter drugs such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and naproxen. in the us, there were about 13,000 more outpatient prescriptions for narcotics per year in 2010 than there were in 1997. in the us, the average cost for a prescription is about us$79.50.a study examining the cost-effectiveness of relatively less expensive low-cost generics found that they generally were more cost-effective than older, more expensive generics. in the united states, the average cost for a prescription of a low-cost generic naproxen was us$340012 a study examining the cost-effectiveness of a limited number of drugs found that they are generally more cost-effective than old, more expensive generics. a study in the uk, examining the use of colchicine for colorectal cancer, found that it may be more effective than older, more expensive generics. a study in hong kong found that the use of colchicine may be more effective than the use of naproxen. a study in india, examining the efficacy of ten drugs with different dosing schedules, found that the drugs with higher dosing schedules had better effects than the less expensive drugs, although the effectiveness was dependent on the degree of tumor burden and the overall safety and efficacy of the drugs.a study in the us found that there was no difference in the overall safety and efficacy of newer drugs for children, adolescents, or adults. the cost-effectiveness of newer drugs is generally lower than newer drugs for the older population.the increased availability of newer, less expensive drugs has had a positive impact on the pharma. many of the drugs that were once reserved for the super-rich are now available to the middle class or even the lower classes, making pharmaceuticals a vital",0,1

bicycles to transport themselves and equipment to and from competitions, events and places of practice such as track, field, and other sports. for example, the gold family uses bicycles to carry around their personal fire. mountain bikers utilize bicycles for these activities as well. the utility of bicycles in the transportation industry is their versatility and affordability, which has attracted a large number of bicycle-friendly products such as bicycles, helmets, and panniers for easy carry in cities and on the road.multiply this number to find the number of bicycle trips and miles travelled per day you can multiply each way. for example, if you can cycle for two hours, and then walk the rest of the way to work, you can safely estimate how many bicycle trips and miles travelled you will need to do each day to meet your daily commuting exercise minimum distances. the most common distances are usually between 05.07. they are usually at an altitude of up to 10,000 metres  most nations have minimum distances that reflect the wind and the average speed of the bicycle. for example, in the united states, a 20-metre  many countries have adopted national laws which have set minimum distances and times for cyclists. for example, in latin america and spain, the colorado national park and the national bike highway system specify distances and times that cyclists must travel. in brazil, the national bike highway system specifies the bicycle must travel at least 90% of the length of the road to reach any given distance.many bicycle manufacturers have released bicycle saddle designs. in the past, the designs varied significantly. today, most bicycles include a range of grips, from narrow, pointy metal inserts to much more complex and unique designs which enable the rider to customize the shape of the handlebars. many bicycle saddles are designed to help the bicycle rider maintain control and comfort while pedaling, including saddles designed specifically for bicycles with two wheels in a fixed position.the bicycle saddle is designed to provide optimal saddle comfort and control in a fixed bicycle position. the saddle is designed to fit snugly into the cyclists hand, preventing the rider from moving it from their saddle position. bicycle saddles are typically made from aluminum, carbon fiber, wood or some other lightweight material. the saddle shape also influences the type of energy absorption that is found in the material. for example, the work of gian marie cassini has shown the energy absorption of bicycle saddles to be significantly higher than for other materials such as carbon fiber, wood or silk.the bicycle saddle is meant to fit snugly into the cyclists hand, preventing the rider from moving it from their saddle

absorption that is found in the material. for example, the work of gian marie cassini has shown the energy absorption of bicycle saddles to be significantly higher than for other materials such as carbon fiber, wood or silk.in order to reduce saddle pressure on the bicycle, some bicycle components are designed to function as springs. the spring-protected part of the bicycle is designed to slide up and down in the saddle to help the rider adjust the saddle pressure as needed. in order to provide a smoother ride, some bicycles are equipped with a dual-pump braking system that uses pressure plates and a spring-loaded system.velocity compensated spring, precision balance, and spring preload are some of the options that are used to adjust the pressure on the bicycle gas turbine. the pressure on the turbine is designed to be designed with a pressure plate and a spring preload in mind. the spring pressure and spring preload design pressure is designed to function like a pressure plate and spring preload, but at a lower pressure than the actual supply of gas turbine power. the design pressure and preload design pressure is designed to function like a spring and preload, but at a lower pressure than the actual supply of gas turbine power. high-pressure air is designed to flow through the bicycle, reducing friction and providing a smooth ride. to solve rotor speed balancing

purity and high concentration of psychoactive compounds make it a dangerous substance, particularly to young people, pregnant women, and others. in the united states, the average age of first possession is around the time of consumption, and one study found first possession for an average of 19.57 days, while another found first possession for an average of 12.41 days. this can lead to a range of adverse health effects, including psychosis, loss of cognitive function, and dependence.smokers begin when the person first experiences the effects of the high. cannabis is primarily psychoactive, but some of its other effects are also detrimental, including its sedative effects and its effect to impair driving ability. long-term use of cannabis is associated with a decrease in a persons ability to drive a vehicle. cannabis may be used to treat conditions such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, palliative care, palliative care, and multiple sclerosis. there is limited evidence that cannabis can help with some forms of amnesia, such as the amnesia that results from stroke, but the long-term effects of use are unknown. a 2016 study found that the symptoms that patients experience when they are given cannabis oil is similar to those caused by amnesiac symptoms.  effects of cannabis use are similar to those of all other commonly used illicit substances including alcohol, cocaine, and methamphetamine.the use of cannabis is associated with a reduction in motor vehicle collisions, as measured by a reduction in the incidence of rear-ended cars from 14% to 9% in a random sample of drivers. the average reduction in rear-ended car collisions was 0.5%, whereas the average reduction in overall car collisions was about 2%. the

effect are not fully understood.the risk of developing certain cancers, including testicular cancer, is increased when cannabis is smoked in combination with tobacco. in particular, the elevated risk is likely due to the chemical composition of cannabis, its terpenes, and its interaction with tobacco.cannabis smoke contains approximately 41 chemical compounds, including the active ingredients in cannabis, cannabinol, tetrahydrocannabinol, and cannabidiol. of these, cannabidiol appears to have the greatest effect on the nervous system. other psychoactive substances also significantly increase the risk of cancer. these include psilocybin, mescaline, ketamine, and delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol.marijuana smoke contains over 9,100 chemicals, including many that are not psychoactive, and these can have effects on the body that are similar to those of the cannabis plant. about half of the chemicals found in marijuana smoke are psychoactive, and about 420 are listed above.the levels of psychoactive chemicals found in marijuana vary from compound to compound.  for example, the most psychoactive compound found so far is cannabidiol, which is the active ingredient in cannabis sativa.

176," he was able to maintain good relations with the british government and military, and was the first to break the back of hostilities with the french by invading leone in 1739. in the same year, he defeated the french in the battle of d6 june 1741. following the death of louis xiv, the french had to back down on the issue of the duchy of azerbaijan, which had been raised by the spanish in the 17th century to protect french trade. louis xivs son by adalhard vi de havannes was killed during the battle, but his son, adalhard ii de havannes, was able to succeed him in the following year. adalhard vii then took control of the duchy of azerbaijan, which was split between the duchy of kosovo and the duchy of serbia. in 1742, he established the kingdom of saudi arabia, which was the first non-spanish kingdom in the middle east. saudi arabia became the dominant power in the area around the middle of the 17th century. the power of the british east india company in the region continued to decline; in the 18th century it had controlled the vast majority of the oil fields in the region and had played a significant role in the development of the british empire. in the 18th century, the dominance of the dutch east india company was eclipsed by the growing power of the british east india company throughout the region. the last dutch ruler, adalhard ii of saudi arabia, in the 18th century, saudi arabia lost control of much of the sea coast to the british empire. the kingdom of sardinia and the peninsula of florence largely disappeared and was absorbed into the british empire. western saudi arabia was absorbed into the british empire in 1874. the kingdom of cairo, founded in 1874, and the kingdom of duhaf were absorbed into the british empire. the kingdom of sardinia, established in 1878, was absorbed into the british empire under the administration of haakon in 1883. the kingdom of daba in 1885, was absorbed into the british empire. the kingdom of saudi arabia and the kingdom of cairo became the royal almighty kingdom of saudi arabia in 1889.the kingdom of saudi arabia arose from the merger of the royal family of saudi arabia with the royal family of sardinia, in 1874. the saudi king succeeded in 1874 after the death of his father, who had succeeded in saudi arabia. the royal marriage took place in 1875, at the hajj al-husayf in mecca. the saudi family was founded by the son of the saudi ambassador to china  the saudi dynasty was established in 1874 by the son of the last saudi king, adalhard ii.the last king of saudi arabia was saudi arabias youngest general, muhammad ibn saud, who succeeded his father in 1876. he spent most of his time at the hajj al-husayf in saudi arabia, attending to matters of state there. the saudi king was a staunch saudi defender of the shia orthodoxy, until the 18th century. he spent most of his time at the hajj al-husayf defending the city of mecca from attack from the salafs. he was known for his keen sense of military strategy and his ability to improvise battlefield tactics. he was, in short, a military genius.in 1878, the saudi arabian congress decreed that saudi arabia would exclusively be a kingdom of saudi arabia, the last of the former saudi possessions in the middle east, and that saudi arabia would be ruled by a king. the change was gradual, and only became officially accepted after the death of the saudi king in 1834.the death of the saudi king in 1834 was short-lived, and the kingdom dissolved into a series of administrative divisions. the new kingdom of saudi arabia however was established just a few years later under the abbasids. it served as a middle power between the two royal houses. the abbasids were the last dynasty to uphold the traditional values of the arabian peninsula and to utilize the saudi oil fields. the saudi kingdom was the dominant power in the region for the next 100 years, until the abbasids overthrew the abbasids and established the ta0th century, saudi leaders invested in the growing agrarian economy. saudi arabias population today consists of about 1.5% of the world population.",0,1
177,"mealworms are shed during the larval phase of the worms life cycle; shed eggs form ""worms"" around the worms core. larvae move up the appendage of the worm and into the crawlers path. inhaling the worms excreta travels with the worms and passes into the ciliate warts of the nectar-bearing flowers. the worms use these warts as a chemical feed.wormwood is a porous, fibrous material used by larvae of the gourametera aquatica to puncture the sticky resin used as a base for their shells and then to build their shells. warts may be found on the surface of the fruit or nectar, in the air, or in the drinking water.wormwood is a highly viscous substance, and the more damaged the worms get, the more viscous wormwood they will produce. in addition, warts can be found in areas where the fruit is ripe, so the worms have a ""holding post"" to secure the food in their stony structures.wormwood is classified by various suppliers as either ""smooth"" or ""chunky"". the smooth warts tend to be uniform in size, while the chunky warts tend to be more streaked than uniform in size. the uniformity of the warts makes them useful as a pest control, as they prevent the warts from sticking to each other. however, some growers prefer to keep the warts out of the plants, using a method that involves soaking the warts in water. this allows the plants to retain some of the water that evaporates during evaporation and prevents the worms from sticking. warts that have been soaked in water can be dried later, ready to use again. the method used to dry the worms is as follows: first remove the worms from the plant by tonguing them into the side of the container, then carefully place the container upside down and keep the lid on the container for fifteen to twenty minutes. the worms should be able to be picked off with a sticky lure, if they are not ejected by the water. if they are stuck, they are ready to be cooked. the longer the worms are stored, the longer they will last. the worms will begin to brown and become black. the black color is caused by the gradual dehydration of the worms. the worms can be eaten raw or cooked, though the cooking causes some problems: the meat may slip from the meat in the liquid stage, and the liquid may become sticky. in the first stage, the worms remain so dehydrated that they do not break down easily. as the worms continue to cook, the color of the meat changes from black to dark golden brown. the worms become very hard, about 3 to 5 minutes. at the end of the cooking process, the meat is cooked through but is still pliable. this is the stage in which the worms become attached to the metal or other materials in the container, and so they may be moved around the containers edges. once attached, the worms remain inert for about five minutes before they become pests. the number of worms harvested per kg of plant is similar in both crops.wormwood is a more expensive product and is usually associated with the use of a high-pressure, bucket-type infestation for controlling bollworms. the use of wormwood in this manner is not recommended as it may harm the plants or the workers who may come in contact with the wood. the wormwood product is more attractive to bollworms as the worms do not damage the plants directly, but they can be carried away by the wind and dispersed by the wind. however, if infested with bollworms, wormwood may be injurious to the bollworm.in the southern united states, the bollworm is controlled by spraying the plants with insecticides. these insecticides are not effective in controlling the main pest, the soil bollworm. the bollworm also attacks plants that are part of the shade-controlling insects, such as tomato plants. shade-controlling insects include the mealybug, brown spider mite, and brown limb moth. shade-controlling insects are typically parasitized by the brown spider mite. the magnitude of this pest depends on the species that are parasitised by the brown spider mite.by altering the relative humidity in the air, some climate change may be responsible for an increase in the number of brown spider mites.reduced salinity of tomatoes, decreased salinity of cucumbers, and the potential reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil through a reduction of ammonium fertiliser use could contribute to the browning of some fruits.some products sold in stores may contain bisphenol. this chemical is a mixture of two organic molecules, both of which are considered to cause the skin irritation and rash it causes. it may also cause the eyes irritation and reddening of redness and staining of the skin. the ingredient in some products is not regulated by the food and drug administration  in some cases,",0,1
