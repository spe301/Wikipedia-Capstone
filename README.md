# Wikipedia-Capstone


## Overview

Wikipedia, as the name implies, is the Encyclopedia of the 21st century! It is an amazing place full of free information mantained by a community of volenteer editors. It has assisted in the removal of barriers when it comes to giving and receiving knwoledge. Unfortunatley, with this great democritization comes the potential spread of misinformation and plagarized content. With the rise of complex transformer models such as GPT2, AI can generate persuasive content that is practically identical to human written text. This is where machine learning can help! We can train a Machine learning model to classify whether or not a body of text has been written by a human or an AI and use other NLP strategies to catch plagarism. If this seems like a problem you care about then keep reading!
